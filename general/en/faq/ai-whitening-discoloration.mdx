<Title>What should I do if the screen turns dark or bluish after enabling skin tone enhancement?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="AI Effects" platform="iOS" />

#### Cause

- If the screen becomes darker as the "intensity" parameter of skin tone enhancement increases, it indicates that the resource path for the skin tone enhancement color lookup table (LUT) has not been set successfully.
- If the screen becomes more bluish as the "intensity" parameter of skin tone enhancement increases, the skin tone enhancement color lookup table (LUT) image may have been compressed.

#### Solution

- If the screen turns dark, please check whether the resource path for the skin tone enhancement color lookup table (LUT) has been set correctly. For details, refer to [Common Features - Face Beautification](/ai-effects-ios-objc/guides/face-beautification#美白).
- If the screen turns bluish, and you have packaged the skin tone enhancement color lookup table (LUT) image into the App, please open the Xcode project, search for PNG in the Target's Build Settings, and set "Compress PNG Files" and "Remove Text Metadata From PNG Files" to "NO". If you are dynamically downloading resources from the network, please check whether the downloaded resource images have been compressed (the PNG Alpha channel must be preserved).
