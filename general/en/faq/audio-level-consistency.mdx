Under certain configurations of the ZEGO SDK, different volume modes are used when the microphone is on and off. For example, call volume is used when the microphone is on, and media volume is used when it is off. This configuration can provide a better experience for most scenarios, but it will also result in volume changes when switching the microphone on/off.


If you want to avoid volume change issues, you can set the application scenario to "COMMUNICATION" or "GENERAL" through the "scenario" parameter when calling the createEngine interface to create the engine.
- In the "COMMUNICATION" scenario, both on and off microphone use call volume.
- In the "GENERAL" scenario, both on and off microphone use media volume.

If you have other requirements for volume mode, you can contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support.
