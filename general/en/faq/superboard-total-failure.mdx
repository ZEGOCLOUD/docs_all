## Problem Description

After integrating Super Board SDK and initializing it, all interfaces fail to call.

## Problem Cause

When all interfaces of Super Board SDK fail to call, it is generally possible that the parameters passed during initialization are abnormal.


## Solution

For interface call failure issues, ZEGO provides the following troubleshooting methods:

1. Check the format and validity of the parameters passed during initialization.
2. Troubleshoot based on the error code returned by the SDK.
