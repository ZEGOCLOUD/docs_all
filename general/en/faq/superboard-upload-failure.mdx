<Title>How to handle Superboard file upload failure?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="File sharing / Super Board" platform="All" />

1. Please troubleshoot the failure reason according to the error code.
2. Please check if the uploaded file complies with the file specification.
3. The Android platform SDK version 2.0 does not support the partitioned storage feature introduced in Android Q. If targetSdkVersion is set to 30 or higher, it will cause file upload failure. The solution is as follows:
- <b>Upgrade the SDK to the latest version (recommended).</b>
- Set targetSdkVersion <=28 to target Android 9 or lower.
- Set targetSdkVersion = 29, and add `android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` in the manifest.

For Android Q storage permission behavior changes, please refer to [Storage - Android](https://source.android.google.cn/devices/storage?hl=zh-cn#permissions).
