### Interface Differences

- Using the `muteMicrophone` interface and setting the mute parameter to false means muting (turning off the microphone). At this time, the SDK will **replace the audio data captured by the device with silent data for publishing**, and the microphone device will still be occupied, and audio-related data will still be present in the publishing quality callback.

    Similar logic interfaces include "mutePublishStreamAudio".

- Using the `enableAudioCaptureDevice` interface and setting the enable parameter to false means turning off the audio capture device. At this time, the SDK **will no longer occupy the audio device**. If publishing is in progress, by default it will **use silent data as audio data for publishing**.


### How to Choose an Interface

- If you must let the SDK release the microphone, such as implementing the function of releasing the microphone after the App goes to the background, you can call the `enableAudioCaptureDevice` interface to turn off the audio capture device, and use the `isMicrophoneMuted` interface to check if the microphone is muted.

- Turning off or on the microphone through the `enableAudioCaptureDevice` interface at the hardware level is a time-consuming operation. If you operate frequently, it will incur certain performance overhead. It is generally recommended to use the `muteMicrophone` interface.
