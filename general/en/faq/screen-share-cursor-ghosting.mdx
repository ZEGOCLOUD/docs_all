<Title>Why does the cursor have ghosting (two cursors displayed) when screen sharing?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Screen sharing" platform="macOS" />

The possible cause of this problem is that when users set the cursor using Qt, since Qt draws through "framebuffer", the Qt cursor will be captured.

Users can call the "zego_screencapture_set_cursor_visible(false)" interface to turn off the cursor drawing inside the SDK, and reset the Qt cursor when entering screen sharing.
