<Title>On the Web platform, when only previewing the published stream without playing streams, there is noise/howling. How to handle this?</Title>

Since local preview does not need to play your own sound, to avoid secondary collection of sound during preview and echo generation, developers need to add a mute attribute to the "video" rendered by the published stream, setting "muted" to "true".
