<Title>What is the alternative solution after the data stream recording product and its related solutions are discontinued?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Cloud recording" platform="All" />




As of May 31, 2024, the **data stream recording product** has been discontinued from the official website. If you want to implement recording for whiteboards, please use the [Cloud Recording - Whiteboard Recording](/cloud-recording/common-features/whiteboard-recording) capability.

## Cloud Recording - Whiteboard Recording Capability Introduction

Whiteboard recording supports recording files and whiteboard signaling operations into a video file.
- In single-stream recording mode, the whiteboard will generate a video file.
- In mixed-stream recording mode, the whiteboard will be mixed with other audio and video streams into one image and generate an audio and video file.
