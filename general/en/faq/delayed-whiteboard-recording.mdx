<Title>When whiteboard recording is enabled, but a whiteboard is added to the room after a period of time, how is the whiteboard recorded?</Title>

The whiteboard will start recording after a new whiteboard is added to the room.
When there is no whiteboard in the room, the whiteboard is not recorded, only audio and video are recorded.
