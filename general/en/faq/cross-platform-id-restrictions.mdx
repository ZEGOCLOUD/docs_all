<Title>When Express SDKs on various platforms interoperate, are there any restrictions on userID/roomID/streamID?</Title>

When SDKs on various platforms interoperate:

- If you need to interoperate with the Web SDK, please do not use '%' in userID, roomID, and streamID.
- If you need to interoperate with the mini program SDK, due to the limitations of the mini program itself, the streamID of the `zego-pusher` and `zego-player` components only supports numbers, English characters, '_', and '-'.

    If your application uses these two components, please note to unify the character usage rules for streamID.

- For SDK interoperability on other platforms, there are no special restrictions.
