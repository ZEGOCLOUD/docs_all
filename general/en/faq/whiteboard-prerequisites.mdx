<Title>What do you need to do before using interactive whiteboard?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Interactive whiteboard" platform="iOS / Android" />



-------

Before using the interactive whiteboard SDK, you need to ensure the following conditions are met:

1. Your AppID has enabled interactive whiteboard functionality.

    If your AppID does not have interactive whiteboard functionality enabled, when you use the ZegoExpress SDK's [loginRoom](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine#login-room) interface to log into a room, the login will fail and you will receive error code 52005033.

    Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable interactive whiteboard functionality.

2. Download ZegoExpress SDK with whiteboard capability.

    Interactive whiteboard SDK needs to be used with ZegoExpress SDK that includes whiteboard capability to work properly. Therefore, please confirm that your ZegoExpress SDK version includes whiteboard capability.

<Note title="Note">


    The [Interactive Whiteboard SDK](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/4406) already includes ZegoExpress-Video SDK (with whiteboard functionality), no need to download separately.

</Note>



3. Refer to [Interactive Whiteboard - Quick Start - Implementation Process](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/8941#3) to create a whiteboard and use basic functions.
