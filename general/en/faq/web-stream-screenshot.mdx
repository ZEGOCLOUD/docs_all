<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Live streaming" platform="Web" />

On the Web platform, when using the "video" tag to render preview and play stream video, developers can implement screenshot functionality through the following methods:
1. After successful preview/play stream, first use the "drawImage" method of the canvas object to draw the data of the corresponding video object to the canvas;
2. After drawing is complete, use the canvas's "toDataURL" method to convert the image to a base64 encoded url;
3. Through the above url, developers can obtain the corresponding screenshot.
