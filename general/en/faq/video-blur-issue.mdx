Video blur is generally caused by low video bitrate or resolution. You can refer to the following troubleshooting steps.

## Self-Check

Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

- Confirm the [ZegoVideoConfig](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-entity-zego-video-config) (such as resolution, bitrate) set by the [setVideoConfig](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine#set-video-config) interface. Try configuring higher resolution and bitrate to see if it can solve the problem.
- Try 4G connection or other Wi-Fi signals to rule out network issues.
- If you are using video preprocessing features, such as beautification, please first disable this feature and check whether the video blur is caused by video preprocessing.
- You can also use ZEGO's Analytics Dashboard (audio and video call quality tracking platform) to confirm the user's network quality and device CPU load.

## Monitor Quality Using Analytics Dashboard

You can use the [Analytics Dashboard](https://console.zegocloud.com) in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) to track the quality of audio and video calls.
