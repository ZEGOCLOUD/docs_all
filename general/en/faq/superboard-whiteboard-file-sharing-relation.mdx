## Guide

- If you are a new user, we recommend using Superboard. Please learn about ZEGOCLOUD Superboard service through [Overview](/super-board-ios/product-desc/overview).
- If you are an existing user of ZEGOCLOUD Interactive Whiteboard and File Sharing services, you can learn about the relationship between Superboard and these two services through this document.
- ZEGOCLOUD will continue to maintain the Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK, but we recommend new users to use Superboard.

## Relationship Between SDKs

Superboard SDK combines the Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK to lower the user access threshold. With the previous SDKs, customers needed a lot of code to implement the linkage between whiteboards and files, as well as synchronization between multiple ends. With the merged SDK, these logics are implemented in the SDK, which can reduce customer access code by 80%.

The orange text in the above figure represents the synchronization operations that customers need to implement themselves when using the Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK separately, and are automatically implemented when using the Superboard SDK, including:

- Synchronized creation and destruction of file views and whiteboard views;
- Synchronized scrolling and page turning between file views and whiteboard views;
- Setting the visible area of the whiteboard view when the file view size changes;
- Synchronized switching of other ends when one end switches files/whiteboards.
