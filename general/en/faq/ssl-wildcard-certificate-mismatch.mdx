<Title>When using a wildcard domain to apply for an SSL certificate, why does the console prompt that the uploaded certificate does not match the domain when uploading the certificate?</Title>

If you receive a prompt that the uploaded SSL certificate does not match the domain when uploading an SSL certificate in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com//), please check if it complies with the following rules:

- Generally has 1 wildcard `*` and starts with `*.`. For example, *.example.com, *.test.example.com, etc.
- Only supports same-level matching, not cross-level matching. For example: a digital certificate bound to the wildcard domain *.example.com supports p1.example.com, but does not support p1.p2.example.com.
