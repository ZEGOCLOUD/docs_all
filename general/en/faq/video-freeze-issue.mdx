<Title>How to handle video freeze issues in Express?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="iOS / Android / macOS / Windows / Flutter" />

Video freeze is a phenomenon that occurs during real-time audio and video transmission where video playback becomes intermittent, unsmooth, or even freezes due to network conditions, device performance limitations, and other reasons.

During Video Call, when the video frame rate is set to no less than 5 fps, if the interval between two consecutively rendered video frames exceeds 500 ms, it is recorded as one video freeze.
When freezing occurs, you can refer to the following troubleshooting steps.


## Self-Check

Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

- Determine whether it is continuous or one-time freezing. One-time freezing is caused by the randomness of the network and device, which is a normal phenomenon.
- Check the network status to determine whether the connection is normal and whether you can access the internet.
- If the network connection is normal but freezing still occurs, try switching to a different network connection to check whether freezing still occurs when the network is in good condition.
- If the network is good and conditions permit, check the CPU usage of each device.
- If you are using video preprocessing features, such as beautification, please first disable this feature and check whether the video freeze is caused by video preprocessing.
- You can also use ZEGO's Analytics Dashboard (audio and video quality operations platform) to confirm the user's network quality and device CPU load.


## Monitor Quality Using Analytics Dashboard

You can use the [Analytics Dashboard](https://console.zegocloud.com) in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) to track the quality of audio and video calls.
