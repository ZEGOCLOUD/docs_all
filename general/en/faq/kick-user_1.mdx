<Title>How to remove a specified user from a room?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="All" />



- - -

In real-time audio and video interaction scenarios, there is usually a need to remove specified users from a room.

For example, in a live room, if a co-hosting user makes inappropriate remarks, the room owner needs to remove that user from the live room.

Currently, you can use ZEGO server API to remove specified users from a room.

#### Interface Call Instructions

For specific calling methods, please refer to [Room User Kick-out Interface](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/kick-out-user).

#### Removal Status Callback

The removed user will receive a callback of the kicked-out status in [onRoomStateChanged](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-callback-i-zego-event-handler#on-room-state-changed). If the user is kicked out by the server due to a user with the same userID logging in elsewhere, the errorCode is 1002050. If the user is manually removed (the developer actively calls the backend [kick out room user](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/kick-out-user) interface), the removal information will be received in "extendeData", and the errorCode is 1002055.
