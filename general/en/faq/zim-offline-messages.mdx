<Title>Why can't ZIM SDK find offline messages in the room?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="In-app chat" platform="All" />



- - - 

In the "room" scenario of ZIM SDK, offline message caching and retrieval are not supported by default.

If you need this, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable the relevant permissions.

- After enabling this feature permission, in **newly created rooms**, users can call the `queryHistoryMessage` interface to query offline messages in that room.

- Rooms created before enabling this feature permission still cannot query offline messages.
