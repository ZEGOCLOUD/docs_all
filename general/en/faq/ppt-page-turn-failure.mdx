### Problem Cause

The slide transition method of the dynamic PPT slide page does not have "Advance slide on mouse click" checked. In this case, clicking on the PPT page cannot turn the page.

### Solution

Set the transition method to "Advance slide on mouse click", then select the "Click" tool, and you can click on the PPT page to turn the page.
