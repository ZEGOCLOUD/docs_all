<Title>How to get the CDN stream playing address on the Web platform?</Title>

The way to get the CDN stream playing address on the Web platform is to consider the following implementation methods:

- If the CDN is applied through the ZEGOCLOUD platform, the playing end can get the relevant stream playing address by listening to the "roomStreamUpdate" callback. If you cannot get it, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support.
- If the CDN is not applied through the ZEGOCLOUD platform, please contact the CDN vendor to get the stream playing address.
- If you do not use the SDK callback to implement this function, the business end needs to synchronize the stream playing address through the business server itself; or send the stream playing address information through ZEGOCLOUD room's [Real-time Messaging and Signaling](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/room/messaging-and-signaling).
