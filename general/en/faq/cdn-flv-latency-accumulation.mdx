<Title>On the Web platform, when playing streams from CDN using FLV format playback, why does pausing and then playing again cause latency accumulation?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Live streaming" platform="Web" />

When the Web platform plays resources from CDN using FLV format, it automatically caches. When pausing and replaying, it will continue playing from the cached data, thus producing latency. The longer the pause time, the greater the latency produced.
