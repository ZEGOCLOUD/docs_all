By default, if there are no users in a room, the room will be destroyed immediately. The following situations will delay destruction.
- ZIM SDK supports setting room delayed destruction through [ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=zim_API~java_android~struct~ZIMRoomAdvancedConfig), with a maximum delay of 3 hours.
- RTC SDK can contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for configuration, with a maximum delay of 30 minutes.
