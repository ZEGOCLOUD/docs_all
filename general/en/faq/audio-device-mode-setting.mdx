## Precautions

1. On **Android and iOS platforms**:

    1. `Call volume` means enabling system 3A, `Media volume` means disabling system 3A.

    2. **Android platform**: Switching the volume mode will cause the device to restart.

        - If local audio playback is already in progress before switching, there will be a stutter during the switching process.
        - If streaming is already in progress before switching, the receiving end will also hear a stutter.

    3. **iOS platform**: Switching the volume mode or turning the microphone on/off will cause the device to restart.

        - If local audio playback is already in progress before switching, there will be a stutter during the switching process.
        - If streaming is already in progress before switching, the receiving end will also hear a stutter.

2. When [enableHeadphoneAEC](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~java_android~class~ZegoExpressEngine#enable-headphone-aec) is set to false, after connecting external devices (such as headphones, external sound cards, etc.), "media volume" is always used, and the audio device mode (audio_device_mode) setting will not take effect.

3. On **macOS platform**: Currently the microphone is always occupied. Call volume uses system preprocessing, and non-call volume uses software 3A processing. The method to distinguish call volume on macOS platform is: first play a piece of music. If it is call volume, when starting our Demo, the music playback will be noticeably quieter; if it is media volume player, when starting our Demo, the music will not have obvious changes. For machines with Apple silicon chips, due to adaptation issues, please be sure to use `General` media volume mode.

4. On **Windows platform**: There is no distinction of audio device mode (audio_device_mode), the microphone is always occupied, and software echo cancellation is used. `Windows platform has no distinction between call volume and media volume.`
