There are two methods: (choose one)

- Method 1: Through the [enableAux](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~java_android~class~ZegoMediaPlayer#enable-aux) interface, enable the media player audio mixing function to mix the media player audio into the `main` published stream. **(Only supports mixing into the main stream)**


- Method 2: Through the [enableCustomAudioIO](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~java_android~class~ZegoExpressEngine#enable-custom-audio-io-1) interface (parameter channel select "ZegoPublishChannelAux", parameter config configure sourceType as "ZegoAudioSourceTypeMediaPlayer"), enable auxiliary custom audio capture, and set the audio capture source to the media player to mix the media player audio into the `auxiliary` published stream. **(Only supports configuring auxiliary stream)**
