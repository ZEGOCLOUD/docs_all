## Problem Description
How many stages does the complete lifecycle of Interactive Whiteboard have? What are they respectively?

## Solution
The lifecycle of Interactive Whiteboard is roughly divided into three stages:

Create whiteboard -> Whiteboard is active (can perform graffiti, data synchronization, etc.) -> Whiteboard is destroyed.

The specific lifecycle is described as follows:

1. Create whiteboard: Call the `createWhiteboardView` interface of the `ZegoWhiteboardManager` class to create `ZegoWhiteboardView`. After successful creation, users in the same room will receive the `onWhiteboardAdded` delegate callback.
2. Whiteboard is active...
3. Actively destroy whiteboard: Call the `destroyWhiteboardView` method of the `ZegoWhiteboardManager` class to remove the whiteboard. After successful removal, users in the same room will receive the `onWhiteboardRemoved` callback notification.
4. Whiteboard is destroyed by SDK after the room no longer exists. If all users exit the room and there are still whiteboards in the room (whiteboards that were not actively destroyed), **the whiteboard will be retained for 15 minutes**, after which the SDK will automatically destroy them.

Prerequisites for normal whiteboard operation:

1. Initialize ZegoExpress SDK and ZegoWhiteboardView SDK.
2. Use the `loginRoom` interface of ZegoExpress to log in to the room.
