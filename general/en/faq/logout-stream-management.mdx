<Title>When Express SDK logs out of a room, is it necessary to actively stop publishing and playing streams?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="All" />



- - -

- In single-room mode, if you call "logoutRoom" to exit the room, or are kicked out by the backend service, the SDK will automatically stop publishing and playing streams.
- In multi-room mode, if you call "logoutRoom" to exit multiple rooms:
    - If roomID is specified, the SDK will automatically stop publishing and playing streams in that room, and other rooms are not affected.
    - If roomID is not specified, the SDK will automatically stop publishing and playing streams in all rooms.

Developers need to follow the above logic and handle the logic of stopping publishing and playing streams according to business requirements.
