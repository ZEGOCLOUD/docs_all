This problem may be caused by the CDN used by RoomKit not being configured with CNAME or HTTPS certificate. The troubleshooting method is as follows:

1. When encountering the problem, you can first open the browser console (taking Chrome browser as an example: press "F12" on the keyboard or right-click the mouse, select "Inspect" in the menu popup) > select "console" to check if there are any errors.
2. If the console shows an error "net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED", please refer to [Configure Domain CNAME](https://doc-zh.zego.im/console/configure-cname) to check if the domain CNAME is configured.
3. If the console shows an error "net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID", please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to confirm whether the CDN address has HTTPS certificate configured. If not, you need to purchase or download a free certificate (Nginx version) from the domain provider (Alibaba Cloud/Tencent Cloud, etc.), and send the certificate to technical support for certificate configuration.
