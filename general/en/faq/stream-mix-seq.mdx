<Title>When using the server-side mixed stream API, what is the function of the "seq" value in the start mixed stream interface?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="All" />



- - -

- For mixed streams initiated with the same "id_name", the size of "seq" will be checked: if a request with a smaller "seq" arrives at the server later, it will not be executed.
- For tasks with different "id_name", the size of "seq" will not be compared.

It is recommended to use only one "id_name" to initiate and update mixed streams.
