<Title>Why can't I make calls through a Bluetooth device after connecting a Bluetooth device to iOS or Android?</Title>

## iOS Device

Due to iOS system limitations, Bluetooth devices that only support the Bluetooth A2DP protocol cannot be used for calls on the iOS call channel. You need to use Bluetooth devices that support the Bluetooth SCO protocol.


## Android Device

On Android devices, for Bluetooth devices that only support the Bluetooth A2DP protocol, the ZEGO SDK will only use Bluetooth A2DP for audio playback, while audio capture uses the phone's built-in microphone.

Except for the above two cases, you can normally use Bluetooth devices for calls.
