<Title>When mixing two streams, if one of them disconnects, will the stream mixing automatically stop?</Title>

The following situations exist:

- When initiating a stream mixing task, if any input stream does not exist, the stream mixing task initiation fails.
- After successfully initiating a stream mixing task, the SDK supports mixing single streams. If an input stream stops, the stream mixing task will automatically retry pulling the disconnected stream for 90 seconds (the disconnected stream image stays on the last frame); after 90 seconds, it will no longer retry. You need to manually call the [stopMixerTask ](https://www.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine#stop-mixer-task) method to stop the stream mixing task.
- After successfully initiating a stream mixing task, if all input streams stop, the stream mixing task will automatically stop after 90 seconds.
