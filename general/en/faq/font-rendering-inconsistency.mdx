<Title>Why is the font display inconsistent across multiple platforms after some files are transcoded?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="File sharing" platform="iOS / Android / Web" />

The source file to be transcoded does not use fonts supported by the official website, and uses Microsoft Office's "embed fonts in file" feature, which itself behaves differently on different systems and browsers.

You need to use fonts supported by the official website to ensure that the fonts in the transcoded file are displayed consistently across multiple platforms. For details, refer to [PPT Supported Font List](/super-board-ios/product-desc/use-restrictions/pptfont).
