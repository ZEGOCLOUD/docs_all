## Problem Description

Does Interactive Whiteboard SDK support using hotkeys to create, delete graphics, scroll, turn pages of whiteboards, and other operations?


## Solution

Yes. Developers can listen to hotkeys at the business layer and call the relevant interfaces of Interactive Whiteboard SDK in the corresponding callbacks to perform the corresponding operations.

For example, if a Web platform developer wants to implement deleting the currently selected graphics when pressing the Delete key on the keyboard, you can refer to the following code:

```javascript
// Listen to keydown event
window.addEventListener('keydown', function (event) {
   const e = event || window.event || arguments.callee.caller.arguments[0];
   if (!e) return;
   switch (e.keyCode) {
       case 46: // Listen to Delete key, batch delete selected graphics
           // Call the whiteboard batch delete selected graphics interface, where zegoWhiteboardView is the target whiteboard
           zegoWhiteboardView.deleteSelectedGraphics();
           break;
       default:
           break;
   }
});
```
