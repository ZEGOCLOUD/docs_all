## Problem Description
After integrating both Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK, how to load shared files through Interactive Whiteboard?

## Solution

In actual use, users often need to use whiteboards and files together. Here we introduce two common scenarios:
#### 1. Users actively create whiteboards with files
For usage guidelines on this part, please refer to:

- iOS: [Collaborative Use of Interactive Whiteboard and File Sharing](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/9870)
- Android: [Collaborative Use of Interactive Whiteboard and File Sharing](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/9871)

#### 2. Developers receive notifications of newly added file whiteboards (`onWhiteboardAdd`)

At this time, you can load files according to the following steps:

a. When receiving a newly added whiteboard from the remote end, get the `fileID` needed to load the file from the `fileInfo` field in the `whiteboardModel` parameter of `whiteboardView`.

b. Create `ZegoDocsView` and display `ZegoDocsView` on the interface.

c. Call the `loadFile` interface of `ZegoDocsView` to load the file.

d. After the file is loaded successfully, adjust the layout of `whiteboardView` according to the actual content layout of the file.
