<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="All" />



- - -

ZEGOCLOUD's self-developed audio and video engine has the following characteristics in audio processing:

- Echo cancellation: In full-duplex scenarios, each party's voice is clear, and the full-duplex experience is good, supporting up to 10 simultaneous speakers.
- Noise suppression: Combined with psychoacoustic models, it can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by more than 20 dB while maintaining voice quality.
- Automatic gain control: Automatically adjusts microphone volume to adapt to near and far sound pickup, maintaining stable volume.
- Full-band audio quality: Supports sampling rates from 16 kHz to 48 kHz.
- Audio effects processing: Supports audio effects such as voice changing, reverb, and virtual stereo.
