<Title>Why can't the audio files embedded in PPT be paused and the progress bar dragged?</Title>

Currently, embedded audio and video in PPT only support:

- Video files: play, pause, and drag progress.
- Pure audio files: only support playback, do not support pause and progress adjustment.

It is recommended to convert the audio file to mp4 format and then insert it into PPT for use.
