<Title>Does Super Board support audio and video file sharing?</Title>

No. It is recommended to implement audio and video file sharing through the method of pushing streams from a local player.

In addition, try not to insert audio and video files in PPT files. If you must insert them, see [File Specification](/super-board-ios/product-desc/use-restrictions/filerule) for item 7 under <b>PowerPoint Presentation Files</b>.
