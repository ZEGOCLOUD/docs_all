<Title>How to set the environment for Web platform Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Transcoding SDK?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Interactive whiteboard / File sharing" platform="Web" />

## Problem Description

When using Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK, you need to set the SDK environment. Are the environments of these two SDKs the same? Will they affect each other?

## Solution

<Note title="Note">


Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Transcoding SDK are two independent SDKs, each with their own test environment and production environment, and do not affect each other.


</Note>



1. Interactive Whiteboard SDK environment setting:
Interactive Whiteboard SDK contains all functions of the Video Call SDK. The setting scheme is exactly the same as the Video Call SDK, and is distinguished by passing in the server during initialization. Passing in the test environment server means the current environment is a test environment.

2. File Transcoding SDK environment setting: Pass in the value of isTestEnv during initialization. The default false means production environment, and setting it to true means the current environment is a test environment.
