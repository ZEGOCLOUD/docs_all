<Title>How to handle the "No version of NDK..." error when compiling Roomkit source code?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Roomkit" platform="Android" />


---

When compiling Roomkit source code, if you encounter the error "No version of NDK matched the requested version", you need to find the local.properties file in the project root directory and add a line at the end of the file:
```java
ndk.dir = ndk_path
```
ndk_path needs to be replaced with the path of the ndk installed on your computer, for example "/Users/yourname/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/21.1.6352462".

<Note title="Note">


If you are not sure where ndk is installed, you can refer to the setting of sdk.dir in the local.properties file. It is usually installed in the ndk subdirectory under the directory set by sdk.dir.
