<Title>What is the maximum number of whiteboards that can be created in a room?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Super Board" platform="All" />


----

A maximum of 50 whiteboards can be created in a room. Creating a whiteboard when 50 whiteboards already exist in the room will fail.
Please use the querySuperBoardSubViewList interface to get the current number of whiteboards in the room.
