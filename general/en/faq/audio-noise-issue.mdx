<Title>How to handle audio noise issues?</Title>

Audio noise is generally caused by external environment or recording and playback equipment. It is recommended that developers try the following steps to handle audio noise issues.

## Self-Check

Refer to the following operations to confirm whether the noise has been eliminated:

- Confirm whether it is a near-field test: the phones at both ends of the communication are in the same room and in a public address state. When the loop gain is greater than 1, near-field howling will occur.
- Confirm whether the audio uses custom audio collection. Custom audio collection itself will not cause noise, but in the process of transmission to the SDK, noise may be generated due to incomplete data. This mode does not support noise suppression.
- Whether the environment on one side of the call is too noisy. For example, the microphone is facing a computer fan, the room is very noisy, the outside of the window is very noisy, etc.
- Confirm whether the recording device is working properly. For example, external sound cards, headphones, and microphone poor contact can cause electrical noise.
- The microphone on the headphones shaking or rubbing against clothes can also produce noise.
- Mobile phone charging or leakage can also produce electrical noise.
