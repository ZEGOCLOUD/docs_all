<Title>What is the difference between ZEGOCLOUD low-latency live streaming and other RTMP + CDN live streaming technology?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="All" />

CDN live streaming technology generally pushes streams through the RTMP protocol and converts to HTTP-FLV or HLS and other TCP protocols when playing streams. It is a common low-cost, large-scale live streaming distribution service.

Different from the most common CDN + RTMP live streaming technology on the market, ZEGOCLOUD's self-developed low-latency live streaming is designed for high-quality experience and is a "hexagon warrior" in live streaming distribution products, creating an ultimate live streaming experience with low-latency, super strong synchronization, resistance to extreme weak networks, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and first-frame instant opening.

ZEGOCLOUD's self-developed low-latency live streaming uses the following technologies to achieve real-time communication quality between the broadcaster and audience at the level of dedicated lines:
- Private transmission protocol
- Private transmission algorithm
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) lines

For specific comparison, please refer to the table below:

|Technology|Common CDN Live Streaming|ZEGOCLOUD low-latency Live Streaming|
|-|-|-|
|Transmission Protocol| RTMP and other TCP protocols|Self-developed private protocol based on UDP|
|Transmission Algorithm|TCP|ZEGOCLOUD private packet loss resistance, bandwidth adaptation and other strategies|
|Network Lines|Single line|BGP|

In addition, to meet developers' diverse live streaming needs, ZEGOCLOUD also provides CDN live streaming push and pull capabilities and has docked with multiple CDN vendors.
