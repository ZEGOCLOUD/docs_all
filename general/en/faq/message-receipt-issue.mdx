<Title>When using the message receipt feature to mark messages as read, why does the unread count in the conversation list not decrease?</Title>

The [message receipt feature](/zim-ios/guides/messaging/read-receipts) refers to the function where after a user sends a message in a conversation, the sender can know whether other users have read or not read this message through this feature. The message receipt feature does not have the function to change the unread count. You can use the following interfaces to change the unread count in the conversation list.

- If you need to clear the unread count of a single conversation, you can call the `clearConversationUnreadMessageCount` interface.
- If you need to clear the unread count of all conversations, you can call the `clearConversationTotalUnreadMessageCount` interface, and then combine it with the business UI display.
