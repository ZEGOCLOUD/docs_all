<Accordion title='1. In the official environment, the detailed debugging information switch in setDebugVerbose:language: has been set to no on the IOS platform, but there are still pop-ups, what should I do?' defaultOpen="false">

Check whether the ZegoExpress SDK is version 1.9.1 and above, if not, you need to upgrade the ZegoExpress SDK version. If there are still popups after the upgrade, you can try to deal with the following two ways:

- **Method 1:**Add when calling [createEngine](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=express_video_sdk_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine#create-engine) to create the engine The following code (global).
```objc
ZegoEngineConfig *config = [[ZegoEngineConfig alloc] init];
config.advancedConfig = @{@"enable_toast_on_test_env": @"false"};
[ZegoExpressEngine setEngineConfig:config];
```

- **Method 2:** Don't use the [sharedEngine](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=express_video_sdk_API~ObjectiveC_ios~class~zego-express-engine#shared-engine) method to get the engine singleton object, but add [ createEngine](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=express_video_sdk_API~ObjectiveC_ios~class~zego-express-engine#create-engine-with-app-id-app-sign-is-test-env-scenario-event-handler) The created engine instance object is stored and called.
> Note: This method will result in no log, which is not conducive to later troubleshooting. The pop-up box is to remind you that there is a problem with the code logic, so that you can troubleshoot and modify it. It is recommended to go online after the test is successful.

<Accordion title='2. When the Unity SDK renders an image onto the grid, why does the shader choose "Universal Render Pipeline > Lit" to render successfully, but choose "Universal Render Pipeline > Unlit" to fail to render?' defaultOpen="false">

The Unity2018 version uses a lightweight rendering pipeline to render video images normally. It is recommended to use the unity2018 version first.
After Unity is upgraded to version 2019, after testing, no matter whether ZEGO or a friend's Unity SDK chooses the "Universal Render Pipeline > Unlit", the image cannot be rendered problem.

<Accordion title='5. Why does the "Background Callback-Recording File Generation Callback" call back twice? And the video content of the two callbacks are the same?' defaultOpen="false">

* In the test environment, there are two recording file formats: MP4, m3u8, two callbacks are required to return two file addresses respectively.
* In a formal environment, it is generally necessary to select one of the formats according to customer needs, and only one callback will be generated at this time.
</Accordion>

- "Pic_url" can be configured with ssl. To configure the domain name as "https", you need to provide the domain name certificate and key.
- The default 20s can be modified.

The above two items can only be modified in the formal environment, but not in the test environment. This function is supported by default in the test environment, and the official environment needs to contact ZEGO technical support for configuration.

On the Web platform, when using the "video" tag to render preview and streaming screens, developers can implement the screenshot function in the following ways:

2. After the drawing is completed, use the "toDataURl" method of canvas to convert the image to a base64 encoded URL;
3. Through the above url, the developer can obtain the corresponding screenshot.
