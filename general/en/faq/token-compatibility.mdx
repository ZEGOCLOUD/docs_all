## Problem Description
During the integration and initialization of File Sharing SDK, there is a key parameter token. Is it the same as the token parameter in the loginRoom interface of Interactive Whiteboard (ZegoWhiteboardView) SDK? Can the tokens of both be used interchangeably?

## Solution
Token is used for identity verification. The token of File Sharing SDK is exactly the same as Interactive Whiteboard, so they can be used interchangeably.
