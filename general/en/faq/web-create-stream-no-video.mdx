<Title>On the Web platform, after creating a stream through the "createStream" method and assigning a value to the "srcObject" of the video object, why is there no video in the video object?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="Web" />

You can handle this in the following two ways:

* You need to set the "autoplay" attribute for the video object to autoplay.
* You can set the "controls" attribute for the video object, and the user can then manually click the playback control to play.

<Note title="Note">
  

The "autoplay" attribute is invalid in Safari browser on iOS. You need to use the second method to handle it.
