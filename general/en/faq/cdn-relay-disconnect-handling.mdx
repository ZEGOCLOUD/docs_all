<Title>On the Web platform, how to handle connection disconnection during the process of relaying streams to CDN?</Title>

Relaying to CDN refers to the process of pushing audio and video streams from ZEGOCLOUD real-time audio and video cloud to third-party or self-developed CDN. Based on this feature, developers can perform larger-scale content distribution, and users can directly watch from web pages or third-party players through URL play stream addresses.

When streaming, the SDK will connect to a ZEGOCLOUD server dedicated to streaming services. When the connection between the SDK and the streaming server is disconnected, it will attempt to automatically reconnect. If reconnection fails, the SDK will trigger the streaming status callback [publisherStateUpdate](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~ZegoRTCEvent&jumpType=route#publisher-state-update), giving the "NO_PUBLISH" status.


```javascript
on('publisherStateUpdate',(result: ZegoPublisherState)=>{
    if(result.state === 'NO_PUBLISH'){
       // todo  something
    }
})
```

When listening to the corresponding status of the above event, developers can first call [stopPublishingStream](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~class~ZegoExpressEngine#start-publishing-stream) to stop all streaming, and then call [startPublishingStream](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~class~ZegoExpressEngine#stop-publishing-stream) in sequence to restart streaming.
