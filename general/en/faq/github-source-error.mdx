## Problem Description

The online Go classroom experience URL can be used formally, but running the source code directly after downloading from GitHub results in an error.

## Problem Cause

1. Need to configure related configuration items.
2. Need to install dependencies.

## Solution

After downloading the source code from GitHub, you also need to build a business server and configure the related environment according to the documentation guide. For details, refer to the documentation [Sample Source Code Running Guide](/faq/roomkit-go-class-alternatives).
