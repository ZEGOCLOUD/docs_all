<Title>Do custom layout, horizontal layout, equal layout, vertical layout, and floating layout all support specifying the whiteboard position?</Title>

Only custom layout supports specifying the whiteboard position. Horizontal layout, vertical layout, and floating layout have the whiteboard in the main screen by default, and equal layout has it in the first screen by default.
