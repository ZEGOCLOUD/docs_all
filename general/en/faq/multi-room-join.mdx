- Trial version: By default, a user can join 1 room at the same time.
- Professional and Flagship versions: By default, a user can join 5 rooms at the same time and can receive messages normally. Use the `fromRoomID` and `fromConversationID` of the `receiveRoomMessage` callback to distinguish which room the message comes from.
- If you need to join more rooms, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable it.
