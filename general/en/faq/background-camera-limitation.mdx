<Warning title="Note">


Apple protects user privacy and manages device resources by restricting background camera access. No application can obtain permission to access the camera in the background. When an app enters the background, iOS automatically revokes camera access permissions to prevent accidental or malicious data collection.

</Warning>



Apple's serious commitment to user privacy means that no form of application can be granted background camera access permissions. When an application is running in the background, iOS pauses or stops camera access. When the application is in the background, developers must pause camera-related features and resume them when the app returns to the foreground.

<Warning title="Note">


Bypassing these protective measures may result in your application being rejected or removed from the App Store.

</Warning>



In Apple's background execution guidelines, the behavior of iOS applications in the background is specified, but due to privacy concerns, it does not include background camera access. For details, refer to [BackgroundExecution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background).

Please ensure that your application respects user privacy and complies with all of Apple's guidelines and policies.
