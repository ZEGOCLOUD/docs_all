As of May 31, 2024, **Avatar Virtual Image**, **MetaWorld Virtual World** two products, and their three supporting solutions (Virtual Nest, Virtual Live Streaming, Virtual Voice Chat) have been delisted from the official website.

You can refer to [Digital Human PaaS Service](/aigc-digital-human-server/introduction/overview) and other AIGC-related products to implement similar scenarios.

## Introduction to Digital Human PaaS Service

Digital Human PaaS Service, based on the underlying AI capabilities of digital humans, through cloud interfaces, helps developers generate digital human file videos or create audio and video streams, flexibly applicable to various digital human scenarios, such as short video creation, live streaming, etc.

<Note title="Note">


If you need to use this product to create live streaming and publish streams, please use it with [Video Call](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/introduction/overview).

</Note>



### Product Advantages

#### Quick Integration

Simply call the server-side API to quickly implement functions. Developers do not need to deploy and maintain the server-side, significantly reducing development costs and helping products go online quickly.

#### Rich Digital Human Configuration

Supports multi-dimensional configuration interfaces through format, resolution, voice, image, etc., flexibly applicable to various application scenarios.

#### Flexible Creation Methods

Supports generating asynchronous video files and real-time audio and video streams to meet short video or live streaming application scenarios.

### Application Scenarios

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Short Video Production</td>
<td>The server-side API interface provides the configuration needed for digital human short video production, including background, image, voice, etc., supporting different video formats and different resolutions, asynchronously generating digital human video files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Digital Human Live Streaming</td>
<td>Developers call the server-side API to create a digital human video stream task, drive the digital human with text or voice, push the stream to ZEGO Real-time Audio and Video Cloud (RTC) in the form of real-time audio and video streams, and the client pulls the stream to watch the live streaming screen, realizing digital human live streaming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interactive Q&A</td>
<td>Developers call the server-side API to create a digital human video stream task. After developers obtain the end-user's question content, they drive the digital human to answer with text or voice, push the stream to ZEGO Real-time Audio and Video Cloud (RTC) in the form of real-time audio and video streams, and the client pulls the stream to get the digital human's reply screen, realizing digital human interaction.</td>
