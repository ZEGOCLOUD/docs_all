Please check if the Xcode version is too old. It is recommended to update to the latest Xcode version.
If you must use an old version of Xcode for packaging, please first find the "Enable Bitcode" option in the "Build Setting" of the project and set it to "NO". Then open the terminal, cd to the DIRECTORY where xxx.framework is located, and execute the following command to remove the Bitcode in the SDK.
```
xcrun bitcode_strip .framework/xxx -r -o xxx.framework/xxx
```
