<Title>How does Express create a room?</Title>

ZEGO Video Call, Audio Call, Live streaming and other products (Express series SDK), if the room does not exist, calling the `loginRoom` interface will automatically create and log into the room.

For details, please refer to [Implementing Video Call - Login Room](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/implementing-video-call#登录房间) (taking Android as an example).
