<Title>What is the timeout duration for file transcoding to load files?</Title>

- Network disconnection: if there is no network, it will immediately return a loading failure callback.
- Weak network: if the download size is less than 1 byte of static files within 10 consecutive seconds, it will be considered a timeout, and a loading failure callback will be returned. (The timeout duration for dynamic PPT depends on the browser's internal timeout mechanism).
