ZIM provides three types of message priorities: high, medium, and low. The server will prioritize pushing high-priority messages. Therefore, it is recommended to set important business information as high priority, for example:

- High priority: red packets, gifts, user bans, etc.
- Medium priority: regular messages, etc.
- Low priority: bullet comments, etc.
