<Title>When will cloud recording receive callback notifications?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Cloud recording" platform="All" />

If you filled in the callback URL address when enabling the cloud recording service on the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), you will receive a callback notification through that URL address after the recording task ends and all recording files are uploaded.
