### Single Stream Recording
- The recording resolution of audio and video is determined by the resolution of the published stream. In simple terms, the resolution width and height of the audio and video is the same as the resolution width and height of the recorded file. No separate setting is needed.
- The resolution width and height of the whiteboard in single stream recording is set according to the `Width` and `Height` parameters in the `Whiteboard` in `RecordInputParams`. This parameter only applies to the whiteboard in single stream recording.

### Mixed Stream Recording
The resolution width and height of the final output file of mixed stream recording is set according to the `MixOutputVideoConfig` parameter in the `MixConfig` in `RecordInputParams`.
