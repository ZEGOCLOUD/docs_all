- File upload transcoding traffic: approximately upload traffic greater than the source file size, plus the traffic of multiple HTTP queries for file status (approximately 300 bytes each time, the specific number depends on the file transcoding duration).
- File download viewing traffic: the file size downloaded depends on the source file type and content.
