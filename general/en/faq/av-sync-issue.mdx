If there is an audio and video out of sync issue, you can refer to the following steps to handle it.


## Problem Troubleshooting

1. If you use custom video collection, please check whether the timestamp of the custom video collection is correct, especially check whether the unit of the timestamp is correct (SDK uses Unix standard timestamp in milliseconds). ZEGO SDK will perform audio and video synchronization internally based on the collection timestamp you provide.

2. If you use virtual camera collection (such as XX live streaming assistant), due to the possible excessive collection delay of the virtual camera, and ZEGO SDK cannot obtain this delay, there may be audio and video out of sync issues. In this case, you can contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support. After analysis and confirmation, the technical support can correct it through advanced engine configuration.


## Monitor Quality Using Analytics Dashboard

You can use [Analytics Dashboard](https://console.zegocloud.com/) in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), to track the quality of audio and video calls.
