<Title>After OBS publishes a stream, the iOS mini program has no audio when pulling the stream. What should I do?</Title>

You can handle it in the following ways:
1. Set the audio channel in OBS to mono.
2. After setting the channel, if there is audio when pulling the stream but the audio is abnormal (with noise), you need to change the sample rate in OBS to 48K.
