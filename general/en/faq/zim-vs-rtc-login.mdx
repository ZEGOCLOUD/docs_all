<Title>What is the difference between ZIM's login interface and Video Call's loginRoom interface?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / In-app chat / Live streaming" platform="iOS / Android / macOS / Windows / Web / Mini Program / Flutter / ReactNative / uni-app / Unity3D" />

ZIM is an instant messaging product, while Video Call is a product focused on the RTC field.

- All functions of Video Call are carried by **rooms**. Logging in means logging into a room. Therefore, logging in with the `loginRoom` interface is the first step to enable audio and video functions.
- ZIM provides developers with full-platform interaction, massive concurrency, ultra-low latency, and guaranteed message delivery communication services. In addition to rooms, there are other modules such as one-to-one chat and group chat messages. Relative to Video Call, there is an additional layer of "account" concept. Therefore, logging in with the `login` interface is the first step to enable ZIM services.

In summary, RTC's "room" tends to be more like the concept of "channel" in audio and video, while ZIM's "room" tends to be more like the concept of "chat room". The business focus of the two products is different. Please note the distinction.
