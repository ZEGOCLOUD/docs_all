The meanings of each scenario are as follows:
- 1V1 Class: 1 instructor provides exclusive online tutoring to 1 student.
- Small Class: 1 instructor conducts online teaching, multiple students watch and listen in real-time, with a maximum class size of 500. During class, the teacher can invite students to "go on stage" to speak and interact with the teacher in Video Call.
- Large Class: 1 instructor conducts online teaching, multiple students watch and listen in real-time, with no limit on class size. During class, students can "raise their hand" to request to speak and interact with the teacher in Video Call.
- Voice Live: Instructors can conduct online teaching through whiteboards and voice, with multiple students watching and listening in real-time. During class, students can interact with the teacher in Audio Call. Suitable for scenarios such as paid knowledge.
