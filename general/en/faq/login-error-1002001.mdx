<Title>Why does Express SDK report error 1002001 when logging into a room?</Title>

Error code "1002001" indicates that a user cannot log into multiple rooms simultaneously. You can solve this in the following two ways (choose one):

- Before logging into a new room, you need to first call "logoutRoom" to exit the current room. Otherwise, the SDK will determine that the current user is logging into multiple rooms, which will produce this error.
- Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable the permission for multi-room functionality.
