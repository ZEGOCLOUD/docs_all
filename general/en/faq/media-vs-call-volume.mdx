Mobile devices have media channels and call channels. Media channels are controlled by media volume, and call channels are controlled by call volume.

The two differ in sound performance, applicable scenarios, and volume control. The specific differences are shown in the table below:

<table>

  <tbody><tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Media Volume</th>
    <th>Call Volume</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sound Performance</td>
    <td>The sound played on the media channel has better expressiveness and sounds more natural.</td>
    <td>The voice on the call channel is more prominent, but the music played sounds somewhat dry. At the same time, the call channel is specifically designed for Video Call. The audio routing provided by the system is more friendly to echo cancellation and can provide better echo cancellation effects.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Applicable Scenarios</td>
    <td>Mainly used in scenarios with certain requirements for sound quality, or music-related scenarios.</td>
    <td>Mainly used in voice call scenarios.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Volume Control</td>
    <td>You can adjust the volume to 0 using the volume keys.</td>
    <td>Due to system limitations, the volume cannot be adjusted to 0.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>



ZEGO SDK provides three preset scenarios: General (general scenario), COMMUNICATION (real-time communication), and LIVE (live streaming scenario), which can meet developers' needs for volume mode selection. In the General scenario, media volume is always used; in the COMMUNICATION scenario, call volume is always used; in the LIVE scenario, it will automatically select call volume and media volume based on the current state of whether streaming is being published, whether there is a connection, etc. The detailed introduction is as follows:


<table>

  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Volume When Mic On</th>
    <th>Volume When Mic Off</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>General (General Scenario)</td>
    <td>Media</td>
    <td>Media</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>COMMUNICATION (Real-time Communication)</td>
    <td>Call</td>
    <td>Call</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LIVE (Live Streaming Scenario)</td>
    <td>Call</td>
    <td>Media</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>


In addition to the preset scenarios mentioned above, if developers have other requirements for volume mode, they can contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for consultation on configuration.
