Web screen sharing can select the target window to share. Different platforms and different choices will have different performances:

- Windows system:
    - Share the entire desktop, can push out the system sound.
    - Share browser tabs, can only push out the sound of the tab.
    - Share other application windows, cannot push out the sound of the application.
    - Screen sharing cannot capture microphone sound. You need the SDK to push a second stream to push the sound captured by the microphone.

- Mac system:

    Cannot push out the system sound, can only push video data.
