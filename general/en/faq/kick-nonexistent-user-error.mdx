<Title>When calling the "room user kick-out interface" to kick out a nonexistent user, will it report an error?</Title>

When calling the ["room user kick-out interface"](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/kick-out-user) to kick out a nonexistent user, the interface will also return success and will not report an error. If there is only one person in the room, after the kick-out is successful, the room will be destroyed by the server.
