<Title>Does Express streaming support setting an encryption key that requires the corresponding key to pull the stream?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="iOS / Android / macOS / Windows / Web" />



- - -

Express SDK **1.19.0** and later versions support this feature. The streaming end uses "setPublishStreamEncryptionKey" to set the streaming encryption key, and the pulling end needs to use "setPlayStreamDecryptionKey" to set the corresponding key to successfully pull the stream.

This feature is only supported on ZEGOCLOUD low-latency servers for co-hosting, not on CDN.
