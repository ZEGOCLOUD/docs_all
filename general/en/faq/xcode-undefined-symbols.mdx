<Title>When Xcode Archive prompts "Undefined symbols for architecture armv7: "_OBJC_CLASS_$_ZegoProduct"", how to handle?</Title>

### Problem Cause

ZegoEffects iOS platform SDK only provides "arm64" and "x86_64" architectures, not "armv7" architecture.
  
Currently, the only "armv7" devices that can be upgraded to "iOS 10" system are "iPhone 5", "iPhone 5c", and "iPad (4th generation)". Since "iPhone 5" and other 32-bit devices have low computing power, running AI applications does not work well.

Additionally, according to the iOS device market share survey in April 2021, the combined market share of these devices is less than 0.1%. Mainstream applications like WeChat no longer support 32-bit devices, and it is expected that Xcode will no longer support building 32-bit iOS applications in 2022.

Therefore, after comprehensive consideration, the SDK only provides 64-bit architecture.

### Solution

Taking ZegoEffects as an example:

- Solution 1: Adjust the minimum iOS version supported by Target to iOS 11.0 or above.

- Solution 2: If you still need to support iOS 10, iOS 9 and other versions, you can specify "Architectures (Release)" as "arm64" in the Target's "Build Settings".
