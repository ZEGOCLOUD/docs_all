## Problem Description
After loading the file whiteboard, after calling the interface to set the file clarity, it does not take effect immediately, and re-rendering also does not work.

## Problem Cause
The transcoding clarity needs to be set before calling the file upload interface, otherwise it will not take effect.

## Solution
The correct order to set transcoding clarity is:
1. Set transcoding clarity interface:
```js
zegoExpessDocs.setConfig(ZegoConfigKey.DynamicPPTHD, 'true')
```
2. Upload file
```js
zegoExpressDocs.uploadFile(file, renderType)
```
