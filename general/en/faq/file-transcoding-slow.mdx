<Title>Why does file transcoding sometimes take a long time?</Title>

## Problem Cause

File transcoding is subject to resource limitations and has queuing logic. The transcoding time is also affected by file size. So when there are many transcoding tasks or the file is large, the queuing or transcoding time will increase, causing the submitted transcoding task to take a long time to complete.

## Solution

It is recommended to complete transcoding of files that need to be shared in advance (for example, submit the transcoding task one day in advance). When you need to use it, you can directly load and use it, avoiding long waiting times for transcoding when sharing is needed, which affects the user experience.
