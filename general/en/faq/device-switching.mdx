Express SDK provides you with a series of interfaces to enable and disable related devices. The specific descriptions are as follows:

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Device</th>
<th>Interface</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Precautions</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Camera</td>
<td>`enableCamera`</td>
<td>Enable or disable the camera on your (local device).</td>
<td>
- `enableCamera` will truly switch the camera device, so frequent use is not recommended.
- When you need to release the camera device, you can call this interface.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Video Screen</td>
<td>`mutePublishStreamVideo`</td>
<td>When pushing stream, whether to send video data. true means not to send.</td>
<td>
- When the broadcaster does not want to publish their own screen, you can call this interface.
- This interface will not truly switch the device, nor will it truly stop pushing stream.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`mutePlayStreamVideo`</td>
<td>When playing stream, whether to play video data in a certain stream. true means not to play.</td>
<td>- When the audience does not want to see a certain person's screen, you can call this interface.- This interface will not truly stop playing stream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Microphone</td>
<td>`enableAudioCaptureDevice`</td>
<td>Enable or disable the microphone on your (local device).</td>
<td>
- The difference from `muteMicrophone` is that this interface will truly enable or disable the microphone device.
- If you need to switch frequently, it is recommended to use the `muteMicrophone` interface.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="3">Audio</td>
<td>`muteMicrophone`</td>
<td>Whether to mute your (local device) microphone.</td>
<td>The difference from `enableAudioCaptureDevice` is that `muteMicrophone` does not truly turn off the microphone, but only replaces the audio data collected by the device with silent data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`mutePublishStreamAudio`</td>
<td>When pushing stream, whether to send audio data. true means not to send.</td>
<td>
- When the broadcaster does not want to publish their own voice, you can use this interface.
- This interface will not truly switch the device, nor will it truly stop pushing stream.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`mutePlayStreamAudio`</td>
<td>When playing stream, whether to play audio data in a certain stream. true means not to play.</td>
<td>- When the audience does not want to hear a certain person's voice, you can use this interface.- This interface will not truly stop playing stream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Speaker/Headphone</td>
<td>`muteSpeaker`</td>
<td>Whether to mute your (local device) speaker/headphone.</td>
<td>After muting, all sounds from the SDK will not be played, including stream pulling, media player, etc.</td>
</tr>
