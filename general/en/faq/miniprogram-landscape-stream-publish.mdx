When screen rotation is allowed, it can be divided into landscape and portrait:

When setting `"pageOrientation": "auto"` on mobile or `"resizable": true` on iPad, screen rotation is allowed. At this time, you can use the Page's `onResize` event or the `wx.onWindowResize` method to listen to this operation, and then determine whether to use landscape or portrait layout.
