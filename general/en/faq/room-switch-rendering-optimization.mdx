<Title>In scenarios where rooms need to be switched frequently, the rendering speed of the playing stream's screen is relatively slow. How to optimize it?</Title>

1. The customer's business side manages the stream ID by itself, and performs stream playing operations while logging in to the room (the order should be to call "LoginRoom" first, then directly call "startPlayingStream").
2. Call "switchRoom" to switch rooms (call "loginRoom" on the first login, and then you can directly use "switchRoom" when exiting and logging in again).
