<Title>Why doesn't the transcoding clarity take effect immediately after setting it, and re-rendering also doesn't work?</Title>

The transcoding clarity needs to be set before calling the file upload interface. Otherwise, after setting, you need to re-upload the file for transcoding to take effect.
