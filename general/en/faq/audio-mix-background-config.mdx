<Title>In an audio-only scenario, how to display a background image for stream mixing?</Title>

In an audio-only scenario, stream mixing does not support background images by default.

If you want to display a background image, you need special configuration from the ZEGO backend. Since this configuration needs to consider the traffic generated by background image transmission, it will increase certain stream mixing costs. Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for consultation.
