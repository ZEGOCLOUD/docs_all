<Title>If a user is in both real-time video and instant messaging rooms at the same time, when leaving the room, should I call the "logoutRoom" interface of Express SDK first, or the "leaveRoom" interface of ZIM SDK?</Title>

Real-time video (Express SDK) and instant messaging (ZIM SDK) are two independent SDKs. When leaving a room, there is no specific order. You can call either interface.

In addition, the "room" of Express SDK is more inclined to the concept of "channel" in audio and video, while the "room" of ZIM SDK is more inclined to the concept of "chat room". The business focus of the two products is different. Please note the distinction.
