There may be the following reasons:
1. No whiteboard in the room. In custom layout, horizontal layout, vertical layout, and floating layout, if the window does not specify a stream ID, the window is retained and displays a background image; if the window specifies a non-existent stream ID, the window is retained and displays a background image.
2. In custom layout, horizontal layout, vertical layout, and floating layout, if padding is set and the whiteboard exits the room, the specified `StreamId` becomes invalid, the whiteboard window will be retained, and the window displays a background image.
3. No whiteboard in the room, and recording whiteboard is set. The window displays a background image.
