## Problem Description

1. To use Super Board functionality, in addition to downloading Super Board SDK from the official website, do I also need to download Video Call SDK?
2. What is the order between Video Call SDK initialization, Super Board SDK initialization, and room login?

## Solution
1. Video Call SDK provides the real-time signaling transmission capability required by interactive whiteboard. Super Board SDK must be used with this SDK. Therefore, if you need to integrate whiteboard functionality, you need to download and integrate both SDKs.

<Note title="Note">


    The Super Board SDK local download package already includes the corresponding version of Video Call SDK, no need to download separately.


</Note>


2. After integrating Super Board SDK and Video Call SDK, the initialization order is as follows:

    1. Initialize Video Call SDK.

    2. Initialize Super Board SDK.

    3. After logging into the room, you can use Super Board and audio and video services.
