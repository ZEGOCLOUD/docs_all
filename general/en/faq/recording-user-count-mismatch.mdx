<Title>When using cloud recording, there are only two real users in the room, but the onRoomOnlineUserCountUpdate callback shows three users?</Title>

Cloud recording is equivalent to a virtual client. When calling the start recording interface, it is equivalent to a user logging into the room to play streams. Therefore, in the `onRoomOnlineUserCountUpdate` callback, it will show one more user than the actual number of real users in the room.
