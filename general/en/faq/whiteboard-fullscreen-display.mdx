<Title>How to make the whiteboard display normally when the browser window is in fullscreen mode</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Interactive whiteboard" platform="Web" />

## Problem Description
When the browser window switches to fullscreen display, if the whiteboard is not processed after the switch, the whiteboard display content will be abnormal. To display the whiteboard normally, some processing is required after fullscreen display.

## Solution
When the whiteboard switches to fullscreen, use the requestFullScreen API + "fullscreenchange" event listener. In the listening callback of the whiteboard fullscreen switch, call the reloadView interface of zegoWhiteboardView to reload the whiteboard to adapt to the current whiteboard container size.

```js
document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', function(e) {
    zegoWhiteboardView.reloadView();
});
```

<Warning title="Note">


requestFullScreen has significant differences in implementation across browsers, and some mobile browsers do not support it. If you need to implement fullscreen effects in mobile browsers, make sure you can correctly switch to fullscreen and call the reloadView interface after the whiteboard mount node size change is complete.
