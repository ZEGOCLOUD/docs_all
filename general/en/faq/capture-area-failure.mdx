The "zego_screencapture_set_target_window_rect" interface must be called before the "zego_screencapture_set_target_screen" interface.

<Warning title="Note">


The following methods should be used in pairs:
- If users only need to capture the desktop screen without filtering windows and only capture the screen area, it is recommended to use: "zego_screencapture_set_target_screen" and "zego_screencapture_set_target_rect".
- If users need to capture windows, window areas, filter windows, capture screens and need to filter windows, it is recommended to use: "zego_screencapture_set_target_window" and "zego_screencapture_set_target_window_rect".

</Warning>
