<Title>When publishing a stream, after calling the "enableTrafficControl" method to enable traffic control, why does only the main stream trigger the traffic control policy when the network quality is poor?</Title>

Currently, the [enableTrafficControl](https://www.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine&jumpType=route#enable-traffic-control) method in the SDK for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows platforms does not have a "channel" parameter and only applies to the main stream by default. When there are two streams being published simultaneously, the auxiliary stream cannot use traffic control.
