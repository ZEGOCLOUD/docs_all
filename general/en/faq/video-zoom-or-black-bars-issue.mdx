Video zoom and black bars are mainly caused by inconsistency between video resolution and display view size, resulting in video image problems. You can refer to the following troubleshooting steps.


## Problem Troubleshooting

Common zoom and black bars situations are as follows:

* If the phone camera orientation and encoding resolution are inconsistent, cropping will occur before encoding, causing video zoom. For example, if the phone screen orientation is portrait and the encoding resolution is landscape, or the phone screen orientation is landscape and the encoding resolution is portrait, there will be obvious zoom. For related information, please refer to [Video Capture Rotation](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/video/video-capture-rotation).
* If the rendering fill mode used by the stream pulling end is [ASPECT_FILL](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~enum~im-zego-zegoexpress-constants-zego-view-mode&jumpType=route#public-static-func-lists) mode, and the video size (encoding resolution) is inconsistent with the display view size ratio, cropping will occur causing video zoom.
* If the rendering fill mode used by the stream pulling end is [ASPECT_FIT](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~enum~im-zego-zegoexpress-constants-zego-view-mode&jumpType=route#public-static-func-lists) mode, and the video size (encoding resolution) is inconsistent with the display view size ratio, scaling will occur causing black bars.
