live streaming UIKit (Live Streaming Kit) allows you to pause/resume receiving streams in a room. This operation does not affect other users and only takes effect locally.

Taking **"pause receiving streams in the room when the application goes to the background, and resume when returning to the foreground"** as an example, the sample code is as follows:

```java
//Activity that added ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveStreamingFragment.
public class LiveActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    ...
     @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        ZegoLiveStreamingManager.getInstance().unMuteAllAudioVideo();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        ZegoLiveStreamingManager.getInstance().muteAllAudioVideo();
    }

```
