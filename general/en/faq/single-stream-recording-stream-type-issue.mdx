<Title>During single stream recording, why does the StreamType set for the whiteboard file not take effect?</Title>

`StreamType` is a parameter for setting the recording to audio, video, or audio-video content. It does not take effect for whiteboard recording. Single stream recording of whiteboards only supports recording as pure video files.
