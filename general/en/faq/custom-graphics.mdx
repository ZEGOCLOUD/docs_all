<Title>What is custom graphics?</Title>



- - -

Custom graphics refers to the ability for developers to set network images as graphics tools. When the default whiteboard graphics provided by ZEGOCLOUD do not meet requirements, this feature can be used to embed more personalized graphics to meet drawing needs in different scenarios.

- Network images support JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats.
- Network images support a maximum size of 500K. It is not recommended to upload overly large images as they may cause display anomalies and other issues.
