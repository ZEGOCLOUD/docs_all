<Title>How to reduce the app size when integrating Native SDK?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="iOS / Android / macOS / Windows" />

This article introduces how to reduce the app size (i.e., package size) after integrating Express Native SDK.

<Note title="Note">



- Native platform mainly refers to Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows platforms.
- For data on the app size increase relative to apps without SDK integration when integrating the latest version of Native SDK, please refer to [Video Call - Overview](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/introduction/overview).

</Note>




## Solution 1: Use Express-Audio SDK (Real-time Voice Version)

When your business does not involve video module-related functions, you can directly use Express-Audio SDK, which can reduce the package size. At the same time, since Express-Video SDK and Express-Audio SDK are compatible in interfaces, you can later easily switch from a pure audio scenario to an audio-video scenario by replacing the SDK.

<Note title="Note">



The download addresses for Express-Audio SDK on each Native platform are as follows:
- iOS: [Express-Audio SDK](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-voice-ios/client-sdk/download-sdk)
- Android: [Express-Audio SDK](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-voice-android/client-sdk/download-sdk)
- macOS: [Express-Audio SDK](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-voice-macos/client-sdk/download-sdk)
- Windows: [Express-Audio SDK](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-voice-windows/client-sdk/download-sdk)
