<Title>How often does ZIM send heartbeats by default? After how long without receiving a user heartbeat will the backend determine it as timeout?</Title>

By default, a heartbeat is sent every 10 seconds. If no user heartbeat is received within 35 seconds, the user is considered offline. Currently, custom configuration is not supported.
