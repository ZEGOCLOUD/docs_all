<Title>When using "switchRoom" to switch rooms, why does the error 1000002 - not logged in appear?</Title>

- Before switching rooms, you need to first call "loginRoom" to log in to room A, and then you can use "switchRoom" to switch to room B.
- If the "fromRoomID" parameter used when calling "switchRoom" is inconsistent with the user's current "roomID", this error will also occur.
