The face slimming area is a rectangle, the head takes up too much of the screen, resulting in no pixels that can be stretched around.
 By using any of the following methods, this problem can be solved:
- Scaling the texture by 1.1 times before displaying it on screen can help reduce this issue.
- Alternatively, you can enlarge the view used to display the image by 1.1 times based on the center of the view.
