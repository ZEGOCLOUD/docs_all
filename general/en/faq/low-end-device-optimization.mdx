<Title>For low-end devices with lower configurations, how to choose capture configuration and encoding resolution to reduce performance overhead?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call" platform="All" />



- - -

Low-end devices with lower configurations, in actual business scenarios, due to poor CPU and GPU performance, need to reduce the data volume during capture and transmission as much as possible, as well as reduce the complexity of data processing, to reduce the overhead in image processing in the process.

The following are several ways to reduce performance overhead.

### Use lower capture configuration

- Use lower encoding resolution.
- Use lower frame rate.
- Use the minimum bitrate required for the current encoding resolution and frame rate.


You can refer to the following recommended configuration:

<table>
  
<tbody><tr>
<th>Video Format</th>
<th>Resolution</th>
<th>Frame Rate</th>
<th>Bitrate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PRESET_180P</td>
<td>180 x 320</td>
<td>15 fps</td>
<td>300 kbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PRESET_270P</td>
<td>270 x 480</td>
<td>15 fps</td>
<td>400 kbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PRESET_360P</td>
<td>360 x 640</td>
<td>15 fps</td>
<td>600 kbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PRESET_540P</td>
<td>540 x 960</td>
<td>15 fps</td>
<td>1200 kbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PRESET_720P</td>
<td>720 x 1280</td>
<td>15 fps</td>
<td>1500 kbps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PRESET_1080P</td>
<td>1080 x 1920</td>
<td>15 fps</td>
<td>3000 kbps</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

### Keep resolution selection consistent

`Capture resolution` and `encoding resolution` should be kept as consistent as possible; if they cannot be consistent, try to make the capture resolution and encoding resolution proportionally consistent.

For example: capture resolution 270 x 480, encoding resolution 180 x 320.

Consistent resolution can ensure that one less scaling is performed during encoding, achieving the purpose of saving performance.

### Choose appropriate capture method

You can enable hardware encoding and decoding by default. If the machine supports hardware encoding and decoding, prioritize using hardware encoding and decoding to reduce CPU performance usage.
