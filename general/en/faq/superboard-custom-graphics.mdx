Custom graphics refers to the ability for developers to set local images or network images as graphic tools. When the default whiteboard graphics provided by ZEGO do not meet requirements, this feature can be used to embed more personalized graphics to meet drawing needs in different scenarios.
- Network images support JPG, JPEG, PNG formats;
- Network image size supports a maximum of 500K. It is not recommended to upload overly large images as they may cause display anomalies and other issues.

To use custom graphics, you need to first use addImage to pass in the graphic to be drawn, then set the whiteboard tool type to custom graphics:
- iOS: Modify the toolType property to ZegoSuperBoardToolCustomImage.
- Android/Web: Call setToolType to set the tool type to CustomImage.
