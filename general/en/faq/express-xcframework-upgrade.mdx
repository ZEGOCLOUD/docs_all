## Problem Description
After upgrading Express from a version before 2.8.0, Xcode compilation error ```'ZegoExpressEngine/ZegoExpressEngine.h' file not found```.

## Solution
XCFramework is a new feature introduced in XCode 11. It is a distributable binary package created by XCode that contains one or more variants of a framework or library, so it can be used on multiple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS), including simulators. It is a more convenient format compared to framework.
To comply with Apple's new app store rules, Zego Express SDK will be provided in XCFramework format from version 2.8.0 onwards. If you have integrated a previous version of the SDK in your project, after upgrading you need to check the following:
- Upgrade to the latest version of Xcode.
- If you are integrating through Cocoapods, please ensure that the Cocoapods version is higher than 1.9.0 (it is recommended to update to 1.10.0 or above). After updating, delete the Podfile.lock file and execute pod install again.
- In Xcode, use the shift(⇧)+command(⌘)+K keyboard shortcut or Product→Clean to clean the project, clear the previous cache, and compile again.
