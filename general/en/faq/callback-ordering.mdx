The public network link is complex, so it cannot guarantee absolute timing accuracy, especially for multiple callbacks triggered within short time intervals.

Based on this situation, ZEGOCLOUD provides a solution for stream callback disorder by maintaining a local stream list. For details, refer to [Callback to Generate Room Stream List Solution](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-server/callback/solution/maintain-the-room-stream-list).
