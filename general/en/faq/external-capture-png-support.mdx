<Title>When using external capture, is it supported to push PNG images with alpha channel?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="iOS / Android / macOS / Windows / Web" />

External capture supports pushing images with alpha channel, but when using SDK rendering (including local preview and playing streams to watch), the transparent part of the image will be displayed as black. The reasons are as follows:

- The SDK currently does not support rendering alpha channel.
- When playing streams from CDN, other players also do not support alpha channel.
