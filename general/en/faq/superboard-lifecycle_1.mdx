## Problem Description
What are the complete lifecycle stages of Super Board? What are they respectively?

## Solution
The lifecycle of Super Board is roughly divided into three stages:

Create whiteboard -> Whiteboard is active (can perform graffiti, data synchronization, etc.) -> Whiteboard is destroyed.

The specific lifecycle introduction is as follows:

1. Create whiteboard: Call the createWhiteboardView or createFileView interface of the ZegoSuperBoardManager class to create a whiteboard.
2. Whiteboard is active...
3. Actively destroy whiteboard: Call the destroySuperBoardSubView method of the ZegoSuperBoardManager class to remove the whiteboard.
4. When all people in the room leave, the whiteboard will be destroyed by default. If you need to keep the whiteboard, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support.

Prerequisites for normal whiteboard operation:

1. Initialize ZegoExpress SDK and ZegoSuperBoard SDK.
2. Use the loginRoom interface of ZegoExpress to log in to the room.
