<Title>When using Express SDK with a mini program as the publish stream end, how does the play stream end get the status changes of the microphone and camera?</Title>

Please note that ZEGO Express SDK cannot transparently transmit the device status of mini programs.

If developers need to get the device status of mini programs (publish stream end) on the play stream end, please use the [setStreamExtraInfo](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_wxxcx~class~ZegoExpressEngine#set-stream-extra-info) interface to set stream extra information on the mini program end (publish stream end), and the play stream end can listen to stream extra information through the [streamExtraInfoUpdate](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_wxxcx~interface~ZegoWechatMiniEvent#stream-extra-info-update) callback.

<Note title="Note">


The callback interface for the play stream end to listen to stream extra information has slight differences in names across different platforms. For example, on iOS/macOS/Android/Windows and other platforms, the name is `onRoomStreamExtraInfoUpdate`, while on Web/mini programs and other platforms, it is `streamExtraInfoUpdate`. Developers should pay attention to the distinction when using it.
