<Title>When the network environment is poor, will Express SDK forcibly make users automatically exit the room?</Title>

When the user's network environment is poor, the SDK will have an internal retry process. If you need to pay attention to the room connection status, please listen to the [onRoomStateChanged](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-callback-i-zego-event-handler&jumpType=route#on-room-state-changed) callback.

- When a user is logging into a room, the room state is LOGINING.
- When a user is normally connected to a room (i.e., successfully logged into the room), the room state is LOGINED, indicating successful connection.
- When the network is disconnected or inaccessible, the user's room state will change from LOGINED to RECONNECTING, which means the connection is being requested, indicating that the room connection is temporarily interrupted and is being reconnected.
    - After successful reconnection, the user's room state will change back to RECONNECTED.
    - If the maximum retry time (20 minutes) is reached and the connection is still not established, the user's room state will change to RECONNECT_FAILED, indicating that the client and room are completely disconnected. The current publishing and playing streams will be stopped, the user will automatically exit the room, and the SDK will no longer perform reconnection internally (it is recommended that you prompt the user that they have been disconnected and can try to check the network situation).
