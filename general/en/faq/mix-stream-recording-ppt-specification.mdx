Yes, it can be specified. In equal layout, the whiteboard screen is fixed as the first screen. In horizontal layout, the whiteboard screen is fixed as the large screen. In custom layout, you can set which screen is the whiteboard screen through the ViewType parameter. The content displayed in the whiteboard screen can be specified by setting WhiteboardId.
