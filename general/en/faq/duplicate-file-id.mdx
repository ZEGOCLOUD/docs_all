<Title>Why does uploading a file multiple times return the same fileID?</Title>

If the uploaded file has the same content as a previously uploaded file, the ZEGO server will determine it as the same file and return the previously transcoded file fileID.

A typical scenario is: when using an Android phone to take photos and upload, if the camera is not turned on when taking photos, the obtained image content will be the same, and the same fileID will be returned.
