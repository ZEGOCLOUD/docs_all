<Title>How to solve the problem of interactive whiteboard SDK login failure on the Web platform?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Interactive whiteboard" platform="Web" />



---

## Problem Description

After integrating the interactive whiteboard SDK on the Web platform and initializing it, login failure occurs.

## Problem Cause

Login failure is generally caused by the following reasons:

1. Network exception.
2. Abnormal parameters passed during initialization.
3. Abnormal parameters passed during login.

<Note title="Note">


The interactive whiteboard SDK on the Web platform includes all functions of the Video Call SDK. The initialization and login process is exactly the same as the Video Call SDK.


</Note>




## Solution

For the causes of login failure, ZEGO provides the following troubleshooting methods:

1. First check whether the network is normal.
2. Check the format and validity of the appID and server passed during initialization.

<Warning title="Note">

    Please ensure that the appID and server are applied through the ZEGOCLOUD Console and have not been modified.

</Warning>


3. Check the format and validity of the parameters passed during login, especially the Token parameter.

<Note title="Note">

    The Token logic needs to be implemented by the developer's business server, or you can use the temporary Token generated by the ZEGOCLOUD Console for debugging.

</Note>


4. Troubleshoot based on the error code returned by the SDK.
