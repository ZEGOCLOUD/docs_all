## Problem Description

What is the relationship between Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK? Do they have to be used together?

## Solution

Interactive Whiteboard SDK and File Sharing SDK are two independent SDKs that do not affect each other and can be used separately.
However, we recommend developers use these two SDKs together, which can provide a better user experience.
