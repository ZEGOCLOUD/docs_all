## Problem Description

1. To use Interactive Whiteboard functionality, in addition to downloading Interactive Whiteboard SDK from the official website, do I also need to download Video Call SDK?
2. What is the order between Video Call SDK initialization, Interactive Whiteboard SDK initialization, and logging in to the room?

## Solution
1. Video Call SDK provides the real-time signaling transmission capability required by Interactive Whiteboard. Interactive Whiteboard SDK must be used with this SDK. Therefore, if you need to integrate whiteboard functionality, you need to download and integrate both SDKs.

<Note title="Note">


    Starting from Interactive Whiteboard version 1.22, the compressed package provided on the Interactive Whiteboard download SDK page already includes ZegoExpress-Video SDK (with whiteboard functionality), no need to download separately.


</Note>


2. After integrating Interactive Whiteboard SDK and Video Call SDK, the initialization order is as follows:

    1. Initialize Video Call SDK.

    2. Initialize Interactive Whiteboard SDK.

    3. After logging in to the room, you can use Interactive Whiteboard and audio and video services.
