If there is a no audio issue, you can refer to the following steps to handle it.

## Problem Troubleshooting

1. You can use the [sample source code](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/run-example-code) provided by ZEGO to test whether there is also a no audio issue. If the sample source code is normal, you can refer to the following methods for troubleshooting.
2. Whether microphone permissions are configured. If not, please ensure that microphone permissions are configured.
3. If it is a PC environment, please confirm whether an audio device is connected. If an audio device is connected, please ensure that you select the connected device as the call device and that the driver is correctly installed.
4. Whether the SDK's mute interface has been called: [mutePublishStreamAudio](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine&jumpType=route#mute-publish-stream-audio) or [muteMicrophone](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine&jumpType=route#mute-microphone).
5. Whether the project's AppID, AppSign, or Token is configured correctly. For specific configuration, please refer to [Quick Start - Implementation Process](https://doc-zh.zego.im/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/implementing-video-call).
