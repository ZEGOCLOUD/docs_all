<Title>How to handle the prompt "Building for iOS Simulator..." when running the App?</Title>

If an error "Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked and embedded framework 'xxx.framework' was built for iOS + iOS Simulator." appears when running an App integrated with RoomKit iOS SDK, the cause and solution are as follows:

After Xcode version 12.3, it is disabled by default to use Framework with iOS + iOS(Simulator) dual-platform architecture. You can select "TARGETS > Build Settings > Validate Workspace" in Xcode and set the value of this parameter to "YES" to continue using traditional Framework.
