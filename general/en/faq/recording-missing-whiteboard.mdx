<Title>Why does the recording task succeed after starting recording, but the whiteboard is not displayed in the recorded video?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Cloud recording" platform="All" />

The video recorded through [StartRecord](/cloud-recording-server/start-record) does not display the whiteboard. There may be the following reasons:

- If the `MixMode` parameter is set to "1 (custom layout)", and all windows' `ViewType` are set to "1 (audio and video)", the whiteboard is not displayed. Only audio and video streams are displayed in the order of audio and video stream publishing.
- The room RoomId has never used a whiteboard.
- The `HasWhiteboard` parameter is set to "false (do not record whiteboard)".
- `WhiteboardId` is not passed in.
