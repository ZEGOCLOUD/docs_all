<Title>Why does the whiteboard window position display audio and video streams?</Title>

There may be the following reasons:
1. The `HasWhiteboard` parameter is set to false. In this case, the whiteboard will not be recorded, and all windows will display audio and video streams.
2. In custom layout, horizontal layout, vertical layout, and floating layout, if the whiteboard is not opened in the room and the window specifies an existing stream ID, the window will display the audio and video stream corresponding to this ID.
