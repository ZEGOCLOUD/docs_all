<Title>During recording, if the whiteboard in the room no longer needs to be recorded, how to operate?</Title>

Only mixed-stream recording with custom layout can achieve this:
Call the UpdateLayout interface at the time point when the whiteboard no longer needs to be recorded, and set all ViewType in the MixInputList parameter to 1.
