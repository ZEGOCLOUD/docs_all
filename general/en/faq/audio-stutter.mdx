<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Video Call / Audio Call / Live streaming" platform="iOS / Android / macOS / Windows / Flutter" />

Audio stutter is a phenomenon that occurs during real-time audio and video transmission due to network, device, physical environment, and other reasons, causing audio playback to be intermittent and not smooth.

During real-time audio and video calls, losing 3 consecutive audio frames is recorded as one audio stutter.

The common situation is caused by poor network on the client side. It is recommended that developers try the following steps to handle stutter issues.

## Self-Check

Check whether the network status is good. You can try switching to a 4G or more stable Wi-Fi environment.

Check whether the current device status is normal. You can ask users to try using WeChat voice or third-party apps.

You can also use ZEGO's Analytics Dashboard (audio and video quality operation platform) to confirm the user's network quality and device CPU load.


## Monitor Quality Using Analytics Dashboard

You can use [Analytics Dashboard](https://console.zegocloud.com/prism) in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), to track the quality of audio and video calls.
