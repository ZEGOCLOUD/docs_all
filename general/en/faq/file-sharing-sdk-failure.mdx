<Title>How to handle the issue where all interfaces of the file sharing SDK are abnormal?</Title>

## Problem Description

After integrating the file sharing SDK and initializing it, all interfaces fail to call.

## Problem Cause

When all interfaces of the file sharing SDK fail to call, it is generally possible that the parameters passed in during initialization are abnormal.

## Solution

For interface call failures, ZEGOCLOUD provides the following troubleshooting methods:

1. Check the format and validity of the parameters passed in during initialization.
2. Troubleshoot based on the error code returned by the SDK.
