1. Use "setPlayVolume", pass in the stream name, and set the volume to 0 to mute a certain stream. To mute multiple streams, configure this interface in sequence (call after pulling the stream).
2. Use "mutePlayStreamAudio", pass in the stream name, and set "mute" to "false" to avoid pulling the audio data of remote users. To mute multiple streams, configure this interface in sequence (can be called before or after pulling the stream).
3. Use "muteSpeaker" to configure muting (turning off) audio output. After muting, no sound from the SDK will be played, including pulled streams, media players, etc.
