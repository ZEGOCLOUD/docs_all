### Single Stream Recording
There may be the following cases:
1. Set padding: After exiting before the recording task ends, continue recording the last frame before exiting; if rejoining before the recording task ends, continue recording from the last frame before the previous exit.
2. No padding: After exiting before the recording task ends, the recording of this stream will automatically end; if rejoining before the recording task ends, a new video will be recorded.
3. Exit the room and rejoin after the recording task ends. You need to restart recording. In this case, regardless of whether padding is set, a new recording file will be generated.

### Mixed Stream Recording
There may be the following cases:
1. Set padding: After exiting before the recording task ends, the window does not disappear and continues recording the last frame before exiting; if rejoining before the recording task ends, continue recording from the last frame before the previous exit.
2. No padding: After exiting before the recording task ends, the window disappears; if rejoining before the recording task ends, the window reappears.
3. Exit the room and rejoin after the recording task ends. You need to restart recording. In this case, regardless of whether padding is set, a new recording file will be generated.
