<Title>Why doesn't the custom layout take effect even though I specified StreamId?</Title>

There may be the following reasons:
1. Horizontal layout, vertical layout, floating layout
- When whiteboard recording is enabled and there is a whiteboard in the room, `StreamId` is invalid, and the whiteboard image always occupies the main view.
- When whiteboard recording is enabled and padding is set, even if the whiteboard stream is interrupted, `StreamId` is invalid, and the whiteboard window will be retained, displaying the background image.
- The specified `StreamId` does not exist.

2. Custom layout
- If there is a whiteboard in the room and a window with `ViewType = 2` is specified to display the whiteboard, specifying `StreamId` for this window is invalid.
- When whiteboard recording is enabled and padding is set, even if the whiteboard stream is interrupted, `StreamId` is invalid, and the whiteboard window will be retained, displaying the background image.
- The specified `StreamId` does not exist.
