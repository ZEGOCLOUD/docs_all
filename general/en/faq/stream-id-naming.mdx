When integrating audio and video SDK, developers need to follow the following constraints when defining streamID:

- String length not exceeding 256 characters.
- Cannot contain URL keywords, otherwise push and play stream will fail.
- Only supports numbers, English characters and "-", "_".

Developers can use userID, or "roomID and userID combination" format to define streamID.

To avoid abnormal situations, it is recommended that developers use the "roomID and userID combination" format to define streamID to ensure the uniqueness of streams in different rooms.
