### Troubleshooting Steps

Please check whether the playback method of the corresponding animation elements in your dynamic PPT is set to execute on click.

### Solution

If the playback method of the animation element is not set to execute on click, please adjust the animation element in the PPT to `execute on click` method, and then re-upload the file.
