There are multiple reasons why you cannot open the camera. You can check according to the following steps:

1. Please confirm whether your device has a camera.

2. Check if the camera has any hardware issues.

    Open the system's built-in video recording app and check if you can record video.

3. Confirm whether the camera permission is enabled.

    - Both Android and iOS systems have camera permission management. Please check in the system settings.
    - Some security software on Android devices can also manage permissions.
    - The Web platform requires https or localhost environment to access device permissions.

4. Check if any other application is occupying the camera.

    If so, close the other application and restart your phone and try again.
