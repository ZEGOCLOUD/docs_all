<Title>When will the floating window video be displayed?</Title>

<ArticleMetadata language="en" product="Call Kit" platform="iOS" />

- When `minimizingButton` is added and the iOS system version is higher than 15.0.0, clicking the floating window button or switching to the home screen will display the video in a floating window. Clicking the floating window video will return to the call page.
- If your system version is lower than 15.0.0, the floating window video will not be displayed.
