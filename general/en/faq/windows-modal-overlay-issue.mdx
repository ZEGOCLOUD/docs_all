### Problem Description

When the whiteboard on the Windows end blocks the user's modal dialog, the user cannot click the program.

### Problem Cause

The whiteboard window does not share the message loop with the user's program. When the user's program pops up a modal dialog, the whiteboard can still be clicked. When the whiteboard window is clicked again, it will cover the modal dialog, causing the user's program to be unable to click.

### Solution

Call `zego_whiteboard_show_view(viewID,false)` to hide the whiteboard view before popping the modal dialog, and call `zego_whiteboard_show_view(viewID,true)` to show the whiteboard view after closing the modal dialog. This way, while the modal dialog is popped up, the whiteboard is hidden and will not cover the modal dialog. Refer to the following MFC code:

```cpp
// Hide whiteboard view
zego_whiteboard_show_view(viewID,false);
// Pop up modal dialog
AfxMessageBox(L"");
// Show whiteboard view
zego_whiteboard_show_view(viewID,true);
```
