Since the publishing end exits abnormally and cannot synchronize this state to the server, the server needs to determine that the stream has stopped through timeout.

After timeout (approximately 100s), if the app is not restarted and the original room is not joined within 100s, the server will send a stream removal message. The pulling end will receive the corresponding stream removal notification through the "onRoomStreamUpdate" callback. At this point, the business should stop pulling the corresponding stream.
