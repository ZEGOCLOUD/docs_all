ZEGO SDK provides echo cancellation functionality that can be applied to most scenarios and devices. If there is an echo problem, you can refer to the following steps to handle it.


## Problem Troubleshooting

<Warning title="Note">



When a user hears an echo, it is often not their own problem, but the echo cancellation function of the other party in the call is ineffective. If it is a multi-party call, you can turn off the other party's microphone one by one to determine which party is producing the echo.



</Warning>



- If you use the echo cancellation function provided by the device itself, but the effect is not good, you can contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support. After analysis and confirmation, the technical support can issue instructions to disable the device's built-in echo cancellation and use the echo cancellation function provided by ZEGO SDK.


- When using the echo cancellation function provided by ZEGO SDK, due to high CPU load or the collection and playback thread being blocked, echo problems may occur. You can self-check through the following operations:

    1. Whether the CPU load is too high or momentarily too high.
    2. Whether audio preprocessing or audio postprocessing functions are used. If so, you need to confirm whether there is a blocking phenomenon in the preprocessing or postprocessing. Generally, audio preprocessing or postprocessing needs to be completed within a maximum of 10ms and return the processing results.


- If during the process of co-streaming, not only the other party's stream is pulled, but also the mixed stream containing your own stream is pulled at the same time, echo problems may also occur.


## Monitor Quality Using Analytics Dashboard

You can use [Analytics Dashboard](https://console.zegocloud.com/prism) in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) to track the quality of audio and video calls.
