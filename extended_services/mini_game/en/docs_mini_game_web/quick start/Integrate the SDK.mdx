# Integrate the SDK

---


## Prepare the environment

Before you integrate ZegoMiniGameEngine SDK, make sure that the development environment meets the following requirements:


- A Windows or macOS based computer that can connect to the internet is prepared.
- The latest version of Google Chrome is used.

## Integrate SDKs

1. Install the SDK by using the node package manager (npm).
   
   Run the `npm i zego-mini-game-engine` command on the terminal to install dependencies.
   
    <Note title="Note">
   
   1. We recommend that you use the TypeScript language for the npm package.
   2. If the npm command fails to run in a macOS or Linux system, "permission denied" is displayed. Add `sudo` before the npm command and run the command again.
   
    </Note>


2. Import the SDK
   
   ```js
   import { ZegoMiniGameEngine } from 'zego-mini-game-engine'
   ```

3. Add the `iframe` tag to the page where you want to mount the game and set the `id`.

     ```html
     <template>
       <div>
         <iframe id="iframe"></iframe>
       </div>
     </template>
     ```

### (Optional) Integrate ZEGOCLOUD Express SDK

If you need to enable the host to launch a barrage game in the browser, you need to additionally integrate the ZEGOCLOUD Express SDK for use. Please refer to [Video Call - Integrate the SDK](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/1031). If your project has integrated the relevant SDK, you can ignore this step.

## What to do next

After you perform the preceding steps, the SDKs are integrated with your project. Then, you can read the following docs to start streaming the live comment-based games:
