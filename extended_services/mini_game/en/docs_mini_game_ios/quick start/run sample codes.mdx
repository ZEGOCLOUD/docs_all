# Run sample code

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD provides sample server code for Node.js and sample client code for iOS. You can create an application and experience all features of the mini-games with activated permissions by running the two scripts of sample code. You can also learn how to implement a mini-game service by reading the sample code.

This topic involves the following sections:

1. Run the sample server code for Node.js
2. Run the sample client code for iOS

<Warning title="Warning">

- The preceding sample code is provided only for your reference. ZEGOCLOUD is not responsible for the maintenance of the sample code.
- The preceding sample code does not pass a rigorous test. If you want to use the sample code in a production environment, perform a rigorous test before release to prevent losses.

</Warning>


## Run the sample server code for Node.js

<Warning title="Warning">

The sample server code cannot be used in a production environment for data security. ZEGOCLOUD is not liable for any risks or losses that are caused if you use the sample server code in a production environment.

</Warning>

### Prepare the environment

Before you run the sample server code for Node.js, make sure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Node.js is installed.
- A computer that runs Windows or macOS is connected to the internet.

### Prerequisites

- A project is created in the [ZEGOCLOUD console](https://console.zegocloud.com). The values of the `AppID` and `ServerSecret` parameters of the project are obtained. For more information, see [How to view project information](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/admin-console/view-project-information).
- The mini-game service is activated by contacting ZEGOCLOUD business staff.
- The sample server code is obtained. For more information, see [Download](../Download.mdx).

### Directory structure of the sample code

The following section describes the directory structure of the sample server code. All file paths involved in this topic are based on the directory structure.

```tree
ZegoMiniGameServerDemo
├── index.js        # The main file.
├── package.json    # The configuration file.
└── utils
  ├── config.js    # Enter the values of the `AppID` and `ServerSecret` parameters that you obtain in the ZEGOCLOUD console.
  ├── gameToken.js # The token generated by the server. 
  └── getToken04.js 
```

### Run the sample code

<Steps>
<Step title="Decompress the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo.zip` package of the sample server code to obtain the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo` folder.">
{}
</Step>
<Step title="Modify the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo/utils/config.js` file by specifying the `appID` parameter in the red-framed part as shown in the following figure.">

Fill in the appId requested from the ZEGOCLOUD console

Fill in the serverSecret  requested from the ZEGOCLOUD console

<Warning title="Warning">

The `https://mini-game-api.zego.im` host address provided in this file is the endpoint of the mini-game server and cannot be modified.

</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo` folder and run the following code on the terminal to start the mini-game server.">

```bash

# Install dependencies.

npm i  

node index.js
```

</Step>

<Step title="Obtain the server address, which can be used as the backend address in the sample client code">

The following figure shows the output after the sample server code is run.

## Run the sample client code for iOS

### Prepare the environment

Before you run the sample client code for iOS, make sure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Xcode 15.0 or later is installed.
- iOS 11.0 or later is installed. We recommend that you use a physical device.
- The iOS device is connected to the internet. We recommend that you use a physical device.
- CocoaPods is installed. For more information about the installation method and common issues of CocoaPods, visit the official website of CocoaPods (https://cocoapods.org/).

### Prerequisites

- A project is created in the [ZEGOCLOUD console](https://console.zegocloud.com). The value of the `AppID` parameter of the project is obtained. For more information, see [How to view project information](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/admin-console/view-project-information).
- The mini-game service is activated by contacting ZEGOCLOUD business staff.
- The sample server code is run. For more information, see the [Run the sample server code for Node.js](#run-the-sample-server-code-for-nodejs) section of this topic.
