# Obtain game activation code

- - -


## Description

To start a  live comment-based game on the PC side, this interface must be called before the game starts. Enter the anchor, room, and game information and receive a unique game activation code.

The game activation code is time-sensitive and will become invalid after it expires. It is recommended that the host obtains the game activation code via this interface each time before starting the game. ZEGOCLOUD guarantees that the received game activation code can be used at least once within 2 hours.

<Warning title="Warning">

Once the game has started, do not call this interface again to get a new start code, otherwise the current game may be forcibly terminated. Whether the game is forcibly terminated depends on the game. It is recommended that this only be called when starting to play or switching between games.
</Warning>
