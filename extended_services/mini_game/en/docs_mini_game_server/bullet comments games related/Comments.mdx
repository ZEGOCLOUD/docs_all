# Send comments

- - -

## Description

Calling this interface triggers the comment event within the live comment-based game, resulting in corresponding effects in the live comment-based game client.

Since specific comments need to be sent to trigger the effects, for example: sending "5" or "6" to join the blue team or red team, please contact the ZEGOCLOUD technical support team to obtain the default comment rules for the game, or to establish the corresponding relationship between specified game comments and operations. If the comment sent by the user does not belong to the agreed content, it will be considered invalid and filtered.

<Note title="Note">

- The game platform will try its best to ensure the validity of comments.
- Please merge users' bullet comments at the room level before sending requests to this interface. It is recommended to integrate users'  bullet comments every 50-200ms.

</Note>
