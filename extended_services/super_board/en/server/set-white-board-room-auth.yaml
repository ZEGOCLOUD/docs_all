      summary: SetWhiteboardRoomAuth
      description: |
        Call this API to set the default whiteboard permissions for a room.
        - After successful configuration, users in this room will use the whiteboard with these room permissions by default.
        - If [user permissions are set separately](/super-board-server/set-white-board-user-auth), those users will use the whiteboard according to their user-level permissions.
        - When a room is destroyed, its permissions are also cleared. After destruction, if users log into a room with the same RoomId and want to use room permissions, they need to set the room permissions again.

        Set the room default permissions to\:

        - Whiteboard can be zoomed and scrolled.
        - Can create graphic elements and modify others' graphic elements.
