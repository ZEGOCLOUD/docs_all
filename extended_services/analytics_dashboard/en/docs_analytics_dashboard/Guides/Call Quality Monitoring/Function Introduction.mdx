### Function Introduction

#### View Push Stream Basic Information

- In the push stream quality page, you can view the basic information of the push stream, including user ID, SDK version, user device system and model, user region, user operator and network information.

    When the basic information such as region, network, etc. changes, an identifier will appear. Hover over this identifier to view the complete information, for example, the network change screenshot:   
        
    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Network_Change_EN.png" /></Frame>


- You can also view the send bitrate, send frame rate, send packet loss rate, and send delay. If you need to further understand the definition of each data, please refer to [Data Description](./Data%20description.mdx).   

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Basic_Publish_Quality_EN.png" /></Frame>

#### View Pull Stream User List

In the push stream quality page, you can view all the pull stream users corresponding to this stream, and view the quality（video receive bitrate, audio receive bitrate, and freeze rate）. If you need to further understand the definition of each data, please refer to [Data Description](./Data%20description.mdx). 

If there are many users in the list, you can search for the specific pull stream user by entering the user ID.

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Chat_Quality_Stream_Publishing_USer_Search_EN.png" /></Frame>

#### Analyze Push Stream Quality

When viewing the basic information of the push stream, you can refer to the following methods to analyze the push stream quality:

- The curve of the send bitrate and send frame rate chart fluctuates less, and the value corresponding to the Y-axis is closer to the target setting value, which means that the push stream of the user is more stable, and more close to your setting target.
- The send packet loss rate and send delay chart represent the network status during the push stream process. The smaller the curve fluctuation, the more stable the network, the closer the value corresponding to the Y-axis is to 0, the better the network quality is.

For example, the curve in the figure has fluctuated (the time period in the red box), according to the chart data of packet loss and delay, it can be judged that the network has fluctuated during this time period, causing the bitrate and frame rate of the push stream to change, which may cause the picture to appear to be frozen、blurred, etc.

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Chat_Quality_Stream_Publishing_Quality_Analysis_EN.png" /></Frame>

#### View Pull Stream User Experience

When viewing the pull stream user list, you can refer to the following methods to analyze the experience of the pull stream user:

- Through the fluctuation trend of the received bitrate, you can judge the experience of the pull stream user. The smoother the curve, the smaller the fluctuation, the more stable the data received when the user pulls the stream, the more stable the user's experience;
- The freeze rate data reflects whether the user has produced a freeze. As shown in the figure below, the red range represents the time period when the user produces a freeze;

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Freeze_EN.png" /></Frame>

- The continuity of the data helps us to judge the pull stream cycle of the user, the interval between the data represents the user's stop pull stream. As shown in the figure below, the user's audio pull stream is divided into two segments;

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Continuity_EN.png" /></Frame>

- You can select the RTC or CDN information in the drop-down list to only view the data of a certain type of service used by the user when pulling the stream. As shown in the figure below, the user pulled the stream using two types of services during the pull stream process.

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Stream_Playing_Sources_EN.png" /></Frame>

- The definition and explanation of the data on the push stream quality page, please refer to [Data Description](./Data%20description.mdx).

##### Pull Stream User Advanced Filter

If you have subscribed to the Analytics Dashboard Professional or Enterprise package plan, you can use the exclusive **Pull Stream User Advanced Filter** function. You can quickly find the problem user that meets the conditions from a large number of pull stream users by setting the filter conditions.

</Frame>

#### Evaluate the Scale of the Problem

You can judge whether the problem is an individual problem of a certain pull stream user, or a collective problem of all users of this stream, the judgment steps are as follows:

1. Check whether the chart data of all pull stream users appears similar fluctuations at the same time, and the push stream user also produces similar fluctuations at the same time.

    As shown in the figure below:

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Same_Problem_EN.png" /></Frame>    

    It can be seen that the pull stream user's curve fluctuates similarly in the same time period, and the push stream user also has similar fluctuations, so it can be judged that the experience problem is caused by the quality fluctuation of the push stream user.

2. If only one user has a freeze in the push stream list, and the other users' chart shows normal, it can be judged that the freeze experience problem is an individual problem of that user, as shown in the figure below:

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Individual_Problem_EN.png" /></Frame>    

3. If it is judged that the problem is caused by the push stream user, you can view the "Pull Stream User Concurrency" to view the concurrency peak number and cumulative number of users of this stream, to evaluate the scope of the problem.

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/Concurrency_EN.png" /></Frame>    

#### Evaluate the Scale of the Problem——Apply Pull Stream Advanced Analysis

If you have subscribed to the Analytics Dashboard Professional or Enterprise package plan, you can use the exclusive **Pull Stream Advanced Analysis** function. This feature helps you intuitively determine the nature of the issue—whether it is an individual problem affecting a specific pull stream user or a collective issue involving all pull stream users. Specifically, you can start from the following aspects:

##### 1 Overall Freeze Analysis

In the user experience module, through the audio and video freeze rate and freeze user number chart, you can understand the average freeze rate and freeze user number of all pull stream users. If the overall pull stream freeze rate increases significantly at a certain problem time point, or the number of freeze users increases significantly, it is likely that it is a collective problem faced by all pull stream users, and in this case, the possibility of an exception on the push stream side is relatively large.

</Frame>

##### 4 Multi-dimensional Drill-down Analysis

In the distribution statistics module, you can further drill down the average freeze situation according to the pull stream source and SDK version dimension. Through this method, you can quickly determine whether the freeze phenomenon is caused by the pull stream source or SDK version. Click the right button, you can also quickly filter out the specified user, and carry out the abnormal analysis.

    <Frame width="auto" height="auto" ><img src="https://media-resource.spreading.io/docuo/workspace564/27e54a759d23575969552654cb45bf89/fa5911dcc6.png" /></Frame>
   

#### Compare to View the Details of the Push Stream End and the Pull Stream End

You can view the basic information, user behavior, and stream quality data of the push stream end and the pull stream end.

- The basic user data includes: user ID, SDK version, system, model, region, operator, network, push stream path, pull stream path.
    - Push stream path: represents the path from the client to the server, such as client → RTC, which means the client directly pushes the stream to the RTC server;
    - Pull stream path: represents the path from the server to the client, such as CDN → client, which means the client pulls the stream from the CDN node.
