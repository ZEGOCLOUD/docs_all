## Overview

To better meet the personalized needs of developers, Analytics Dashboard officially launched on **August 1, 2023** and provided `Free`, `Pro`, and `Enterprise` three-tier package plans. Each package plan supports [Call Insights](./../Guides/Call%20Insights/Function%20introduction.mdx), [User Monitoring](./../Guides/User%20behavior%20monitoring.mdx), and [Operation Dashboard](./../Guides/Operations%20Dashboard/Function%20introduction.mdx) functions, with different functional services and pricing standards. Developers can choose to subscribe to the package plan according to their business needs.

After [subscribing to plan](#subscribing-to-plans) and taking effect, the related functions will be automatically enabled, and you can immediately experience all the functions supported by the package plan.

<Note title="Note">

Data Storage and Query Description:

- Different package plan feature modules have different data storage and query days.
- When upgrading from `Free` to `Pro` or `Enterprise` package plan: The data corresponding to the corresponding days will be stored from the date of subscription, and only the currently stored data can be queried, not the data corresponding to the package plan days (because it has not been stored yet); when upgrading from `Pro` to `Enterprise` package plan, the same applies.
- If you subscribe to multiple package plans at the same time, only one package plan will take effect at a time, and the data will be stored according to the corresponding days of the "highest package plan" and queried according to the corresponding days of the "current package plan".

## Pricing Standard

ZEGOCLOUD provides two billing methods: `Overage Payment` and `One-time Payment`.

Among them, **"Usage Quota" refers to the service duration of users using ZEGOCLOUD RTC and L3 audio/video services for streaming.**

When the RTC/L3 usage of users is within 1000,000 minutes, no additional fee is required. If it exceeds, it needs to be paid by thousand minutes. For example, assuming that the usage of a user is 1001000, if the Professional Edition is purchased, then the monthly subscription fee of 1999 yuan needs to be paid, and the excess fee of 0.99 yuan (1000 minutes) will be settled in the subsequent bill.

### Overage Payment

### Subscription Rules

- Default each account can use the `Free` package plan. You can purchase the `Pro` or `Enterprise` package plan according to your needs, and the package plan will take effect immediately after purchase, with a validity period of "natural month".
- For example, if you subscribed to the "Overage Payment - Pro" package plan for 1 month on July 8, 2023, the package plan will be valid until July 31, 2023.
- The new package plan subscribed by the `Pro` or `Enterprise` user will take effect on the 1st day of the next month, without affecting the use of the package plan for the current month. The subscription fee for the current month will not be refunded, and the excess usage for the current month will be charged at the excess price of the original package plan.
- If you use the "Overage Payment" method, the excess usage fee for the package plan will be displayed and settled in the subsequent bill.

<Note title="Note">
Only the main account can subscribe to the package plan, and the sub-accounts will automatically inherit the corresponding functions of the package plan of the main account.
</Note>


### Auto-renewal Rules

- All package plans **default to enabling auto-renewal service**. When renewing, the package plan will be automatically renewed and charged on the 1st day of the next month after the current package plan expires.
- If your account balance is not enough to pay for the auto-renewal fee, the system will not automatically renew the current paid package plan, and will automatically switch to the `Free` package plan; otherwise, the current package plan will be automatically renewed.
- You can click "My Plan" in the top right of the Stargraph plans page to view your subscription details.
