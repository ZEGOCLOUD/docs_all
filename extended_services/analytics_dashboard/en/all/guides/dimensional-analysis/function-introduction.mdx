# Function Introduction

---

With Dimensional Analysis, you can analyze various metrics from different dimensions, including user experience, service quality, and business scale. For each metrics, you can also view the corresponding detailed data, from the specific user, stream, and room levels, to assist in analyzing and solving push/pull stream problems.


## Overview

Dimensional Analysis includes 3 sub-pages, each of which carries different functions:

| Sub-page-15% | Function |
| -- | -- |
| Dashboard Page | You can select metrics from different categories within a certain period of time, such as user experience, service quality, and business scale, and display them in time trend charts to help you find problems. <br/>For the selected metrics, you can also analyze and view them through comparison and filtering to further analyze the reasons for the problems. |
| Multi-dimensional Analysis Page | Display the distribution of metrics in different dimensions, including data distribution, country/region, network type, platform system, SDK version, pull source, and operator, to help you conduct metrics drilling to trace the cause and lock in the root of the problem。 |
| Data Detail Page | Used to further view the specific user, stream, or room information of the metrics in the selected time and dimension, to quickly obtain analysis examples and assist in problem solving. |

## Access Steps

1. Log in to the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), and enter Analytics Dashboard from the left navigation bar.
2. Subscribe to the [package plan](/analytics-dashboard/introduction/pricing), and activate the "Dimensional Analysis" function.

### Function Introduction
#### Select the metrics to analyze

Select AppID and time range, click "Add analysis metrics", and you can select the metrics you need to analyze, up to 5 at most. After determining the metrics, you can view the overall situation (mean/total value) of the selected metrics, and the trend of each metric over time.   
Some metrics also support adding auxiliary metrics. When only one such metrics is selected, you can check whether to "Add frequantly used auxiliary metrics".

</Frame>
The comparison related to the filter dimension (comparison total, comparison each filter option) needs to select the dimension first before comparison. For example, when the filter dimension selects Android and iOS as the platform systems, and compares each filter option, at the same time point, the metrics values of different platform systems will be displayed at the same time.
