# Function Introduction

---

With Dimensional Analysis, you can analyze various indicators from different dimensions, including user experience, service quality, and business scale. For each indicator, you can also view the corresponding detailed data, from the specific user, stream, and room levels, to assist in analyzing and solving push/pull stream problems.


## Overview

Dimensional Analysis includes 3 sub-pages, each of which carries different functions:

| Sub-page-15% | Function |
| -- | -- |
| Dashboard Page | You can select indicators from different categories within a certain period of time, such as user experience, service quality, and business scale, and display them in time trend charts to help you find problems. <br/>For the selected indicators, you can also analyze and view them through comparison and filtering to further analyze the reasons for the problems. |
| Multi-dimensional Analysis Page | Display the distribution of indicators in different dimensions, including data distribution, country/region, network type, platform system, SDK version, pull source, and operator, to help you conduct indicator drilling to追溯原因，锁定问题根源。 |
| Data Detail Page | Used to further view the specific user, stream, or room information of the indicator in the selected time and dimension, to quickly obtain analysis examples and assist in problem solving. |

## Access Steps

1. Log in to the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), and enter Analytics Dashboard from the left navigation bar;
2. Click "Dimensional Analysis" in the navigation bar, and you can access the "Dashboard Page".

### Function Introduction
#### Select the indicators to analyze

Select AppID and time range, click "Add Analysis Indicator", and you can select the indicators you need to analyze, up to 5 at most. After determining the indicators, you can view the overall situation (mean/total value) of the selected indicators, and the trend of each indicator over time.   
Some indicators also support adding auxiliary indicators. When only one such indicator is selected, you can check whether to "add common auxiliary indicators".

#### Compare different time/dimension indicators

Click "Compare Mode", you can add comparison lines on the trend chart, including time period comparison, filter dimension comparison-comparison total, filter dimension comparison-comparison each filter option three types of comparison.
<Frame width="512" height="auto" >
  <img src="./dashboard-4.png" />
</Frame>
The time period comparison can compare yesterday/last week/last month. For example, when the time period comparison-comparison yesterday is selected, at the same time point, both the current day and the previous day's indicator values will be displayed.
<Frame width="512" height="auto" >
  <img src="./dashboard-5.png" />
</Frame>
The comparison related to the filter dimension (comparison total, comparison each filter option) needs to select the dimension first before comparison. For example, when the filter dimension selects Android and iOS as the platform systems, and compares each filter option, at the same time point, the indicator values of different platform systems will be displayed at the same time.
