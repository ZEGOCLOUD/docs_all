# Data Description

This document describes the data related to the "Dimensional Analysis" function module.

## User Experience

The following indicators are typically used to measure the user experience of the video quality service. When the indicator value is large, the user side usually会出现卡顿、延迟、丢包等情况，导致体验较差。

| Analysis indicators-15%         | Description |
|------------------|------|
| Audio Stutter Rate       | The definition of audio stutter: The duration of audio stutter is the duration of the audio stutter when the rendering interval between two audio frames exceeds 200ms (default).<br/>Audio stutter rate = (the sum of the audio stutter duration in one sampling period / the total duration of audio in one sampling period) x 100%. |
| Video Stutter Rate       | The definition of video stutter: The duration of video stutter is the duration of the video stutter when the rendering interval between two video frames exceeds 500ms (default).<br/>Video stutter rate = (the sum of the video stutter duration in one sampling period / the total duration of video in one sampling period) x 100%. |
| Audio First Frame Delay     | The duration of the interval from the user requesting to pull the stream to the completion of the first frame audio decoding, used to evaluate the waiting time for the user to hear the first frame sound. |
| Video First Frame Delay     | The duration of the interval from the user requesting to pull the stream to the completion of the first frame video decoding, used to evaluate the waiting time for the user to see the first frame picture. |
| Enter Room Delay         | The duration of the interval from the user requesting to login to the successful login of the room, used to evaluate the waiting time for the user to login the room. |
| End-to-End Delay       | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the overall duration of the stream from the push stream end to the pull stream end rendering out the picture. <br/><Warning title="Note">Different from the Upstream Delay and Downstream Delay, the end-to-end delay includes the time of audio and video rendering, the value may be affected by business logic (If the network problem is serious, in order to ensure the smoothness of the video, the local data buffer will be relatively large, and the corresponding end-to-end delay will be relatively large.)</Warning> |
| Upstream Delay         | The indicator of the push stream end, representing the single-way duration of the push user pushing data from the client to the server. |
| Downstream Delay         | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the single-way duration of the pull user pulling data from the server to the client. |
| End-to-End Packet Loss       | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the overall packet loss situation from the push client to the pull client. |
| Upstream Packet Loss         | The indicator of the push stream end, representing the packet loss situation of the push user pushing data from the client to the server. |
| Downstream Packet Loss         | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the packet loss situation of the pull user pulling data from the server to the client. |

## Service Quality

The following indicators are typically used to measure the service quality of the video quality service. By viewing the overall success rate and the distribution of various error codes, it can be tracked to understand whether there are大面积影响用户正常登录/推流/拉流/混流的故障发生。

| Analysis indicators-20%               | Description |
|------------------------|------|
| Login Success Rate             | Evaluate the situation of the client normally initiating the login request, to the successful login of the room, observing this indicator can track and understand whether there are大面积影响用户正常登录的故障发生.<br/>Calculation formula: Success login times / Total login request times x 100% |
| 5s Login Success Rate           | Evaluate the situation of the user initiating the login request, in 5s内正常登录房间的情况，观察该指标可跟踪了解是否出现大面积影响用户正常登录的故障发生。<br/>计算公式：5s内成功登录次数 / 总登录请求数 × 100% |
| Push Stream Success Rate             | Evaluate the situation of the client normally initiating the push stream request, to the successful push stream的情况，观察该指标可跟踪了解是否出现大面积影响用户正常推流的故障发生。 |
| Pull Stream Success Rate             | Evaluate the situation of the client normally initiating the pull stream request, to the successful pull stream的情况，观察该指标可跟踪了解是否出现大面积影响用户正常拉流的故障发生。 |
| Service-side Mix Stream Request Success Rate   | The request ratio of the mix stream task successfully completed on the service side. This indicator reflects the stability and reliability of the mix stream service. |
| Client-side Mix Stream Request Success Rate   | The request ratio of the mix stream task successfully completed on the client side. |


## Usage Scale

Used to help analyze the total change trend of the video quality service scale, or monitor the peak load of the system.

| Analysis indicators-20%               | Description |
|------------------------|------|
| Audio Effective First Frame Count         | The number of frames of the first frame of audio data collected after the push stream end sends valid data, and the pull stream end successfully calls the pull stream interface. |
| Video Effective First Frame Count         | The number of frames of the first frame of video data collected after the push stream end sends valid data, and the pull stream end successfully calls the pull stream interface. |
| Login Request Count             | The total number of login room requests initiated by the client. |
| Push Stream Request Count             | The total number of push stream requests. |
| Pull Stream Request Count             | The total number of pull stream requests. |
| Service-side Mix Stream Request Count       | The total number of mix stream requests initiated by the service side. |
| Client-side Mix Stream Request Count       | The total number of mix stream requests initiated by the client side. |
| Room Concurrent Count             | The peak number of rooms that exist concurrently. |
| Push Stream Concurrent Count             | The peak number of push stream services used. |
| Pull Stream Concurrent Count             | The peak number of pull stream services used. |
| Mix Stream Task Concurrent Count           | The peak number of mix stream tasks that are initiated concurrently. |
| Total Audio Pull Stream Duration         | The total duration of the audio stream pulled. When multiple audio streams are pulled within the same time period, the duration of all audio streams is summed up and calculated. |
| Total Video Pull Stream Duration         | The total duration of the video stream pulled. When multiple video streams are pulled within the same time period, the duration of all video streams is summed up and calculated. |
| Total Pull Stream Duration             | The total duration of the audio stream and video stream pulled. When multiple audio streams or video streams are pulled within the same time period, the duration of all audio streams and video streams is summed up and calculated. |
