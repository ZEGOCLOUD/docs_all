# Data Description

- - -

This document describes the data related to the "Dimensional Analysis" function module.

## User Experience

The following metrics are typically used to measure the user experience of the video quality service. When the metric value is large, the user side usually experiences issues such as lag, delay, and packet loss, resulting in a poor experience.

| Analysis metrics-20%         | Description |
|------------------|------|
| Audio Stutter Rate       | The definition of audio stutter: The duration of audio stutter is the duration of the audio stutter when the rendering interval between two audio frames exceeds 200ms (default).<br/>Audio stutter rate = (the sum of the audio stutter duration in one sampling period / the total duration of audio in one sampling period) x 100%. |
| Video Stutter Rate       | The definition of video stutter: The duration of video stutter is the duration of the video stutter when the rendering interval between two video frames exceeds 500ms (default).<br/>Video stutter rate = (the sum of the video stutter duration in one sampling period / the total duration of video in one sampling period) x 100%. |
| Audio First Frame Delay     | The duration of the interval from the user requesting to pull the stream to the completion of the first frame audio decoding, used to evaluate the waiting time for the user to hear the first frame sound. |
| Video First Frame Delay     | The duration of the interval from the user requesting to pull the stream to the completion of the first frame video decoding, used to evaluate the waiting time for the user to see the first frame picture. |
| Enter Room Delay         | The duration of the interval from the user requesting to login to the successful login of the room, used to evaluate the waiting time for the user to login the room. |
| End-to-End Delay       | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the overall duration of the stream from the push stream end to the pull stream end rendering out the picture. <br/><Warning title="Note">Different from the Upstream Delay and Downstream Delay, the end-to-end delay includes the time of audio and video rendering, the value may be affected by business logic (If the network problem is serious, in order to ensure the smoothness of the video, the local data buffer will be relatively large, and the corresponding end-to-end delay will be relatively large.)</Warning> |
| Upstream Delay         | The indicator of the push stream end, representing the single-way duration of the push user pushing data from the client to the server. |
| Downstream Delay         | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the single-way duration of the pull user pulling data from the server to the client. |
| End-to-End Packet Loss       | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the overall packet loss situation from the push client to the pull client. |
| Upstream Packet Loss         | The indicator of the push stream end, representing the packet loss situation of the push user pushing data from the client to the server. |
| Downstream Packet Loss         | The indicator of the pull stream end, representing the packet loss situation of the pull user pulling data from the server to the client. |

## Service Quality

This section generally refers to various success rate metrics. By examining the overall success rate and the distribution of different error codes, you can monitor and identify whether large-scale failures are affecting users' ability to log in, push streams, pull streams, or use mix stream features normally.

| Analysis metric-20%                  | Description |
|------------------------|------|
| Login Success Rate             | Evaluates the ability of the client to successfully initiate a login request and enter the room. By observing this metric, you can determine if there are large-scale failures impacting normal user logins.<br/>Formula: Number of successful logins / Total number of login requests × 100% |
| 5s Login Success Rate           | Evaluates whether users can successfully log in to a room within 5 seconds after initiating a login request. By observing this metric, you can monitor for significant login failures.<br/>Formula: Number of successful logins within 5 seconds / Total number of login requests × 100% |
| Push Stream Success Rate             | Evaluates the ability of the client to successfully initiate and complete a push stream request. By observing this metric, you can track whether large-scale push stream failures are occurring. |
| Pull Stream Success Rate             | Evaluates the ability of the client to successfully initiate and complete a pull stream request. By observing this metric, you can track whether large-scale pull stream failures are occurring. |
| Service-side Mix Stream Request Success Rate   | The ratio of mix stream requests that are successfully completed at the service side after a mix stream request is initiated. This metric reflects the stability and reliability of the mix stream service. |
| Client-side Mix Stream Request Success Rate   | The ratio of mix stream requests successfully completed as recorded by the SDK after a mix stream request is initiated. |


## Usage Scale

Used to help analyze the total change trend of the video quality service scale, or monitor the peak load of the system.

| Analysis metrics-20%               | Description |
|------------------------|------|
| Audio Effective First Frame Count         | The number of frames of the first frame of audio data collected after the push stream end sends valid data, and the pull stream end successfully calls the pull stream interface. |
| Video Effective First Frame Count         | The number of frames of the first frame of video data collected after the push stream end sends valid data, and the pull stream end successfully calls the pull stream interface. |
| Login Request Count             | The total number of login room requests initiated by the client. |
| Push Stream Request Count             | The total number of push stream requests. |
| Pull Stream Request Count             | The total number of pull stream requests. |
| Service-side Mix Stream Request Count       | The total number of mix stream requests initiated by the service side. |
| Client-side Mix Stream Request Count       | The total number of mix stream requests initiated by the client side. |
| Room Concurrent Count             | The peak number of rooms that exist concurrently. |
| Push Stream Concurrent Count             | The peak number of push stream services used. |
| Pull Stream Concurrent Count             | The peak number of pull stream services used. |
| Mix Stream Task Concurrent Count           | The peak number of mix stream tasks that are initiated concurrently. |
| Total Audio Pull Stream Duration         | The total duration of the audio stream pulled. When multiple audio streams are pulled within the same time period, the duration of all audio streams is summed up and calculated. |
| Total Video Pull Stream Duration         | The total duration of the video stream pulled. When multiple video streams are pulled within the same time period, the duration of all video streams is summed up and calculated. |
| Total Pull Stream Duration             | The total duration of the audio stream and video stream pulled. When multiple audio streams or video streams are pulled within the same time period, the duration of all audio streams and video streams is summed up and calculated. |
