# User Behavior Monitoring

- - -
User Monitoring helps you trace back and analyze the audio and video experience of users from a user perspective. You can view the user's room footprint, overview the user's push/pull stream and behavior event information, evaluate user experience, locate and analyze the root cause of audio and video quality problems, and finally help you solve problems and improve user experience.

## Function Overview

User Monitoring includes the following 2 sub-pages, each of which carries different functions:

|Sub-page|Function|
|--|--|
|Search Page|<ul><li>Search by user ID, you can get the list of all rooms logged in by this user within the query time.</li><li>Search by room ID, you can get the list of all users logged in this room within the query time.</li></ul>|
|User Details Page|<ul><li>Understand the online status, user behavior, and Abnormal situation of the user in a specific room lifecycle, establish a user behavior portrait.</li><li>Overview the user's push/pull stream, understand the order of the user's push/pull stream and the length of each stream, view the push/pull stream quality, locate the stream with poor user experience.</li><li>View the push/pull stream quality data, analyze the reason for the abnormal audio and video experience of the user, solve problems, and improve user experience.</li></ul>|


## Access Steps
1. Log in to the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), and enter Analytics Dashboard from the left navigation bar;
2. Click "User Monitoring" in the navigation bar, and you can access the "Search Page".
3. Click "View User Quality" in the search result, and you can access the "User Details Page" to view the user quality.

## Search Page

### Sample Page
1. Search by user ID

### Function Introduction
1. View user room footprint

    In the search page, enter the user ID, adjust the time range, click "Query", you can view all rooms entered by the user within the specified time range, view the room ID, room start and end time, and the platform information used by the user when pushing and pulling streams.

    <Note title="Note">

    The room start and end time refers to the time when the user logs in and logs out of this room. If the user logs in and logs out multiple times, the time when the user first logs in to the room and the last logs out of the room is taken as the room start and end time.
    </Note>

2. View all users in a specific room lifecycle

    In the search page, enter the room ID, adjust the time range, click "Query", you can view all users in the room lifecycle, understand the user volume entering the room, user login and logout room time, and the platform used by the user when pushing and pulling streams in the room.

    ZEGOCLOUD will actively identify users that have abnormal behavior in the room, you can get the abnormal user list by "Filter Abnormal Users", and further view the abnormal problem and root cause by "View User Quality", solve user abnormalities.

### Function Introduction

**View the online status of the user in the room**

In the timeline area, the first axis shows the user's online status in the room. You can see the periods when the user is online (light blue) and the periods when the user is offline (gray). This allows you to clearly and intuitively determine whether the user has entered and exited the room multiple times, as well as understand the user's continuous online status.

**View the push/pull stream record of the user in the room, and quickly determine whether there is audio and video freezing**

In the time axis area, from the second axis (dark blue), all push/pull stream records of the user within this time (arranged in chronological order by the start time of the stream) are displayed. You can understand the start and end time, push/pull stream duration, and whether there are multiple push/pull stream occurrences for the same stream.

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/yonghujiance/liushijianzhou_EN.png" /></Frame>

**View the user behavior in the user lifecycle, restore the user interaction scenario, and analyze the user audio and video experience**

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/yonghujiance/yonghuxingwei_EN.png" /></Frame>

The first axis in the time axis area also displays user behavior (yellow identifier) to help you understand the user's behavior at different times, and analyze whether the audio and video quality problem is related to the user's behavior. The following table lists some typical behavior events:

|Event| Description|
|-|-|
|Open/Close Microphone|The push stream user opening or closing the microphone may cause the pull stream end user to not hear the sound.|
|Open/Close Camera|The push stream user opening or closing the camera may cause the pull stream end user to not see the picture.|
|Open/Close Speaker|The pull stream user opening or closing the speaker may cause the user to not hear the sound.|
|Switch App to Background/Foreground|The user switching the app to the background/foreground may cause the push/pull stream to interrupt.|
|Switch Network Type|Switching the network type may cause the network quality to change.|

**Low-threshold, high-efficiency, and quick identification of anomalies, analysis of the root cause of anomalies, and resolution of anomalies**

ZEGOCLOUD will actively identify abnormal events in the user lifecycle, and classify events based on severity into "abnormal" and "reminder", helping you quickly locate anomalies, understand the details and reasons of anomalies, and solve anomalies.

You can view the abnormal events through the following methods:
- Click the "abnormal" and "reminder" events under each category in the "User Diagnosis" module to view the event details;
  <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/Prism/yonghujiance/zizhuzhenduan_EN.png" /></Frame>
- Hover the mouse over the red period on each time axis in the time axis area to view the abnormal event information corresponding to the current time.

**View the stream quality data, analyze the reason for the impact on the audio and video quality**

In the time axis area, select the stream you want to view, click the corresponding stream time axis, and you can view the detailed quality data of this stream in the area below, including:
- User basic information
- Bitrate
- Frame rate
- Packet loss rate
- Delay
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Resolution
- Microphone input volume (push stream data)
- Speaker output volume (pull stream data)
- User audio experience (pull stream data)

You can go to [Data Explanation](./call-insights/data-description.mdx) to view the detailed introduction of each metric.

**View the push/pull stream configuration information**

View the configuration information of the user when pushing and pulling the stream, help you analyze and judge whether the push/pull stream configuration settings are normal, whether the configuration items corresponding to the configuration value change during the call, so as to judge whether the change of audio and video quality is related to the configuration.

The configuration information is displayed according to the push/pull stream cycle, if the user pushes and pulls the stream multiple times, multiple records will be displayed.

<Note title="Note">

Currently, only the configuration information of the Native and Web platforms is supported.
