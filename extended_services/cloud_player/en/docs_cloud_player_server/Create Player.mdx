It must be within 256 bytes in length and only supports numbers, English characters, '-', and '_'. <strong>Please note that within the same AppID, the StreamId must be unique. If this parameter is not filled in, ZEGOCLOUD server will assign an ID randomly.</strong> |
| PlayerName | String | No | The name of the cloud player. It must be within 64 bytes in length and is empty by default.<ul><li><strong>Within the same AppId, there can be multiple cloud players with empty PlayerName, but multiple running cloud players with duplicate PlayerName are not allowed.</strong></li><li><strong>The name of a destroyed player (PlayerName) can be created and used again, but it is recommended that developers avoid creating players with the same PlayerName.</strong></li></ul> |
| VideoOptions | Object | No | Video transcoding parameter configuration.<strong>Please note that when this parameter is not filled in, the fields it contains will use default values.</strong> |
| └Width | Number | No | The width of the video. The value range is [1, 3000], and it must be a multiple of 2. The unit is px. The default value is the width of the original media resource.<strong>Please note that when either Width or Height is set to 1, it represents audio-only streaming.</strong> |
| └Height | Number | No | The height of the video. The value range is [1, 3000], and it must be a multiple of 2. The unit is px. The default value is the height of the original media resource.<strong>Please note that when either Width or Height is set to 1, it represents audio-only streaming.</strong> |
| └VideoBitrate | Number | No | The video bitrate. The value range is [1, 50000], and the unit is kbps. The default value is the recommended bitrate given by ZEGOCLOUD based on the resolution and frame rate. For details, please refer to the "Use default values" in <a href="https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/video-call/common-video-config?platform=android&language=java#4_1" target="blank">Set up common video config</a>.For example, when the input resolution is 360*640, the VideoBitrate of the output stream is set to 600 kbps. |
| └VideoCodec | Number | No | The video encoding format.<ul><li>0: H264, default value.</li><li>2: VP8.</li><li>3: H265.</li></ul> |

| └AudioCodec | Number | No | Audio codec and sampling rate.<ul><li>0: AAC-LC, sampling rate: 44100 kHz, default value.</li><li>1: HE-AAC, sampling rate: 44100 kHz.</li><li>6: OPUS, sampling rate: 48000 kHz.</li></ul> |
| └AudioBitrate | Number | No | Audio bitrate, range is [1, 192], unit is kbps, default value is 48 kbps. |
| └SoundChannel | Number | No | Number of audio channels.<ul><li>1: Mono, default value.</li><li>2: Stereo.</li></ul> |
| └Volume | Number | No | Volume value, range is [0, 200], default value is 100, representing the original volume of the audio. |
| PlayTime | Number | No | Unix timestamp (in seconds) when starting to play the online media stream. <strong>Range is [CreateTime - 86400, CreateTime + 1800] (CreateTime is the creation time of the cloud player, which will be returned after a successful call to this interface. To increase the limit, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support)</strong>, default value is 0, indicating that the online player will automatically start playing the online media stream when it is created successfully.<ul><li>When PlayTime = CreateTime, the cloud player will automatically start playing when it is created successfully.</li><li>When PlayTime &gt; CreateTime, the cloud player will start loading media resources after it is created successfully, and start playing at the set PlayTime, achieving the effect of scheduled playback.</li><li>When PlayTime &lt; CreateTime, the cloud player will start playing from the position corresponding to <code>CreateTime - PlayTime</code>. For example, when cloud player A encounters an exception during operation, you can create a new cloud player B and set B's PlayTime to the Unix timestamp when A starts playing. When B is created successfully, it can start playing directly from the current progress of A.</li></ul>For example, if CreateTime is 20:00 in the evening, when PlayTime is 20:00, the cloud player will start playing directly after it is created successfully; when PlayTime is 20:10 (CreateTime + 600), the cloud player will start loading resources after it is created successfully, and start playing at 20:10; when PlayTime is 19:55 (CreateTime - 300), the cloud player will start playing directly from the 6th minute of the media stream. |
| RepeatTimes | Number | No | Number of times to play.<ul><li>1: Play the media stream once, default value.</li><li>-1: Auto loop play.</li><li>n: Custom number of times to play the media stream, must be greater than 0.</li></ul> |

Range is [5, 600], unit is seconds, default value is 300 seconds.<ul><li>After the idle state exceeds the set MaxIdleTime, the player will be automatically destroyed.</li><li>If MaxIdleTime is less than 5, ZEGOCLOUD server will automatically adjust it to 5; if MaxIdleTime is greater than 600, ZEGOCLOUD server will automatically adjust it to 600.</li></ul> |
| StreamData | Object | No | Data configuration carried by real-time media stream (such as playback progress information). This data will be transmitted as SEI information along with video frames, and can be obtained by the pulling party through listening to the <a href="/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~java_android~class~IZegoEventHandler#on-player-sync-recv-sei" target="blank">onPlayerSyncRecvSEI</a> callback of the client.The SEI information transmitted by this parameter is in JSON format by default, and developers can parse it according to the JSON format. For example, if the SEI content is <code>null</code>, where CloudPlayerPlayingProgress represents the current playback progress of the video frame, and 1000 represents the current playback progress is 1000ms. |
| └Enable | Number | No | Whether to enable StreamData configuration.<ul><li>0: Disable, default value.</li><li>1: Enable.</li></ul> |
| └Interval | Number | No | Set the SEI information sending frequency (in milliseconds) for transmitting StreamData data, default value is 1000, indicating that a SEI information carrying StreamData data will be sent every 1 second. |
