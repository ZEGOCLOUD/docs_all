# Multi-sector recording (Whiteboard)
---


Cloud recording supports recording audio, video streams, and whiteboard files, which is multi-sector recording. And this mode can be used in conjunction with the single-stream and mixed-stream recording modes. In single-stream recording mode, the whiteboard recording will be generated into a single video file. In the mixed-stream recording mode, the whiteboard recording, audio, and video streams will be generated into a file. 


We currently support the following image file formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP.


This document describes how to implement multi-sector recording by using cloud recording APIs.


## Implementation


To record the whiteboard, set the `HasWhiteboard` to `true` when calling the [`StartRecord`](/en/cloud-recording-server/start-recording) method.

The `Whiteboard` is an array in JSON format that consists of the configurations of the whiteboard. You can only configure one whiteboard for now.


<Warning title="Warning">

* The `HorizontalRatio` and `VerticalRatio` parameters indicate the aspect ratio of the original whiteboard region and are required.
* The `Width` and `Height` parameters indicate the resolution of the outputted whiteboard video in single-stream recording mode. While you don't need to set these two parameters in mixed-stream recording mode.
* The `WhiteboardId` parameter indicates the ID of the whiteboard that is being recorded.
</Warning>

To change a whiteboard, call the [`UpdateWhiteboard`](/en/cloud-recording-server/whiteboard-update) method, and set the `WhiteboardId` parameter with the ID of the whiteboard you want to change to.


## Sample request
