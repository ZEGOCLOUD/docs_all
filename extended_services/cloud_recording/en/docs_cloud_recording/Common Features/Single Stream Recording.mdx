# Single-stream recording
---


We currently support the following cloud recording modes:

* Single-stream recording: All the audio, video streams, and whiteboard recordings in a room are recorded in separate files.

* Mixed-stream recording: The audio, video streams, and whiteboard recordings in a room are recorded in a single file.

This document describes how to implement single-stream recording by using the cloud recording APIs.


## Implementation

To use the single-stream recording, call the [`StartRecord`](/en/cloud-recording-server/start-recording) method, and set the `RecordMode` parameter to **1**.

You can select the format of the recorded file as needed by setting the `OutputFileFormat` parameter to `mp4`, `flv`, or `hls`. 

For instance, set the `OutputFileFormat` parameter to `mp4`, and the generated recordings are varies based on the content to be recorded:

|Content to be recorded|Parameter|Recorded file|
|:----|:----|:----|
|Audio only|Set `StreamType` to "1"| The audio streams of each specified stream ID are recorded in a single mp4 file. |
|Video only|Set `StreamType` to "2"|The video streams of each specified stream ID are recorded in a single mp4 file. |
|Audio and video (mixed)|Set `StreamType` to "3"|The audio and video streams of each specified stream ID are recorded in a single mp4 file. |
|Record audio and video (separate)|Set `StreamType` to "4"| The audio and video streams of each specified stream ID are recorded in an mp4 and an aac file. The mp4 file contains the video data, and the aac file contains the audio data.|

<Warning title="Warning">

`StreamType` is only applicable to audio and video streams. All whiteboard files will be recorded in mp4 files, and only contain the whiteboard related video data. 
</Warning>


## Sample request


- `Content-type`: `application/json;charset=utf-8`

The request example of `StartRecord` is as follows:

```json
{
	"RoomId": "xxxx",
	"RecordInputParams": {
		"RecordMode": 1,
		"StreamType": 3,
		"MaxIdleTime": 60
	},
	"RecordOutputParams": {
		"OutputFileFormat": "mp4",
		"OutputFolder": "record/"
	},
	"StorageParams": {
		"Vendor": 2,
		"Region": "oss-xxxx",
		"Bucket": "xxxx",
		"AccessKeyId": "xxxx",
		"AccessKeySecret": "xxxx"
	}
}
```
