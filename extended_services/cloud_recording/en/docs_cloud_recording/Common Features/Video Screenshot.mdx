# Capture screenshots
----

Cloud Recording supports taking screenshots of video streams at fixed intervals in **Single-Stream Recording mode** (not supported in Mixed-Stream Recording mode). Screenshots are saved in JPG format.

This document describes how to take video screenshots by using the cloud recording APIs.

<Warning title="Warning">

Screenshot operations in Single-Stream Recording mode will be charged at Single-Stream Recording rates, even when only taking screenshots.
</Warning>


## Implementation 

To capture screenshots, set the `OutputFileFormat` to `jpg` when calling the [`StartRecord`](/en/cloud-recording-server/start-recording) method. 
You can also set the interval as needed by setting the `SnapshotInterval` parameter. The service takes a screenshot of all streams every 10 seconds by default.


<Warning title="Warning">

* Taking screenshots is only available when the `RecordMode` is 1 (single-stream recording mode).
* Taking screenshots is not **available** when the When `StreamType` is 1 (only audio).
* When querying screenshot task status through the [DescribeRecordStatus](/en/cloud-recording-server/recording-status-check) method, the response parameters will not include the file list.
</Warning>

The captured screenshots during recording will be uploaded to your third-party cloud storage, and you will receive a notification through a callback every time a screenshot task is completed.


## Sample request


`Content-type`: `application/json;charset=utf-8` 


The request example of `StartRecord` is as follows:

```json
{
    "RoomId": "xxxx",
    "RecordInputParams": {
        "RecordMode": 1,
        "StreamType": 3,
        "MaxIdleTime": 60
    },
    "RecordOutputParams": {
        "OutputFileFormat": "jpg",
        "OutputFolder": "record/",
        "SnapshotInterval": 10
    },
    "StorageParams": {
        "Vendor": 2,
        "Region": "oss-xxxx",
        "Bucket": "xxxx",
        "AccessKeyId": "xxxx",
        "AccessKeySecret": "xxxx"
