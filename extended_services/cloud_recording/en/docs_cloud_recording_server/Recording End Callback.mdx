# Callback of the recording status
---

<Warning title="Warning">
Callback services cannot guarantee complete reliability. Please carefully consider the risks of using callback solutions to build core business processes.
</Warning>

## Description

To receive a task status event immediately upon a status change, you need to provide a callback URL when enabling the Cloud Recording service. 

During recording, an HTTP request will be initiated to the callback URL using the POST method and the request message body is in JSON format.

<Note title="Note">

ZEGOCLOUD will update parameters (for example, add parameters or values) in the recording status callback method in future iterations. Therefore, avoid performing hard coding upon integration. Otherwise, incompatibility may occur after a version iteration.
</Note>

## Source verification

Checks whether a callback request is initiated from the Cloud Recording service.

### Verification method

Check whether the calculated signature is the same as that carried in the callback request. The following figure shows how to calculate a signature.

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption="">
  <img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/server_v2/Verify_signature_en.png" />
</Frame>

* `nonce`: parameter in the callback request
* `timestamp`: parameter in the callback request
* `callbacksecret`: generated during project registration on the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com). 

### Sample code

Sample code in PHP:

```PHP
$signature = $_POST["signature"];
$timestamp = $_POST["timestamp"];
$nonce = $_POST["nonce"];

$secret = callbacksecret;// Callback secret obtained in the background.
$tmpArr = array($secret, $timestamp, $nonce);
sort($tmpArr, SORT_STRING);
$tmpStr = implode( $tmpArr );
$tmpStr = sha1( $tmpStr );

if( $tmpStr == $signature ){
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```

Sample code in Java:
```java
// Obtain the values of signature, timestamp, and nonce from the request.
String signature = request.getParameter("signature");
long timestamp = request.getParameter("timestamp");
String nonce = request.getParameter("nonce");

// Back end obtains callbacksecret
String secret = callbacksecret;

String[] tempArr = {secret, ""+timestamp, nonce};
Arrays.sort(tempArr);
        
String tmpStr = "";
for (int i = 0; i < tempArr.length; i++) {
    tmpStr += tempArr[i];
}
tmpStr = org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.sha1Hex(tmpStr);

return tmpStr.equals(signature);
```

## Sample response

```
$timestamp = 1470820198;
$nonce = 123412;
$secret = 'secret';
	
Original string requiring encryption after ranking splice:1234121470820198secret
The result of encryption will be:5bd59fd62953a8059fb7eaba95720f66d19e4517
```

## Return code

HTTP status code 2*XX* (such as 200) indicates success and all other return codes indicate failure.
