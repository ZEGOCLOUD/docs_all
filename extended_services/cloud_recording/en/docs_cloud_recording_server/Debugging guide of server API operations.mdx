# Debugging guide of server API operations

- - -
This document describes how to perform server API testing by using Postman.

As an API commissioning tool, Postman enables you to visually and conveniently test server APIs on graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

To help you test the cloud recording server API, ZEGOCLOUD provides the corresponding Postman Collection, which has the pre-defined request parameters of each API. In this manner, you can perform the commissioning test after they import the parameters and modify the parameter values.

## Prerequisites

- Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Download and decompress [Collection of the cloud recording API](https://docservice-storage.zego.im/cloudrecord/cloudrecord_postman_collection.zip).
- Complete the steps described in [Enable the cloud recording service](/cloud-recording/quick-starts) and obtain the related information required for API calls, such as **AppID** and **ServerSecret**.  

## Import and configure the collection 

1. Click **Import** to import the files obtained when **collection** is decompressed.

2. Set the environment to **cloudrecord**.

3. Open the **cloudrecord** environment, set **AppID** and **ServerSecret** obtained in the Prerequisites steps in **CURRENT VALUE** of the corresponding environment variables, and save the settings.

## Testing APIs

You can see three APIs below as examples to show how to test the server APIs by using Postman.

<Note title="Note">
The collection provided by ZEGOCLOUD can use environment variables and preset scripts to automatically specify common parameters. You can view the preset scripts in the following figure, which can be used for reference when you develop the server.

### Start recording

This API is used to start the recording task and implement single-stream recording, mixed-stream recording, and screenshot capture depending on the passed-in parameters.
Four groups of request parameters for this API are preset in the collection provided by ZEGOCLOUD, which correspond to single-stream recording, mixed-stream recording (grid layout), mixed-stream recording (customized layout), and screenshot capture. Multiple recording tasks can be started at the same time in the same room.

#### Single-stream recording

In single-stream recording mode, each audio or video stream and whiteboard in the room are respectively recorded. The corresponding media file is generated for each audio or video stream, and a video file is generated for all whiteboards.

1. Choose **StartRecord_Single** in **Collections** and view the **Body** tab.

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/CloudRecording/postman/StartRecord_Single.png" /></Frame>

    <Note title="Note">
    - **RoomId**: The ID of the recording room.
    - **RecordInputParams**: The input parameters of the recording task. The preset parameters in the request indicate that only the audio of stream 1 and stream 2 is recorded, and a media file is generated for each stream. Other optional parameters retain the default values.
    - **RecordOutputParams**: The output parameters of the recording task. The preset parameters in the request indicate that MP4 media files are output to the **test** folder of the storage service.
    - **StorageParams**: The storage configuration of the recording task.
    </Note>

    Modify the request parameters as required and perform the commissioning test. For more information about the parameters, see [Start recording](./Start%20Recording.mdx).
    
2. Click **Send** to check the response. If the error code in the response is not 0, modify the request based on the error description of the response and send the request again. Ensure that **TaskId** returned in the response is saved.

#### Mixed-stream recording

In mixed-stream recording mode, all audio or video streams and whiteboards in a room are recorded in a mixed manner to an audio and video file. Mixed-stream recording supports multiple image layout modes. For more information, see [Set mixed-stream layout](/cloud-recording/common-features/set-the-mixed-flow-layout).  
Two groups of parameters for split layout and customized layout are preset in the collection provided by ZEGOCLOUD.

**Grid layout**

1. Choose **StartRecord_Mixed_Split** in **Collections** and view the **Body** tab.

    <Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/CloudRecording/postman/StartRecord_Mixed_Split.png" /></Frame>

    <Note title="Note">
    - **RoomId**: The ID of the recording room.
    - **RecordInputParams**: The input parameters of the recording task.
    - **RecordMode** and **StreamType**: Indicate that the recording mode is set to mixed-stream recording, and the recording content is set to audio and video file.
    - **FillBlank**: Specifies the image filling method when the stream recording is interrupted. If it is not specified, the default configuration is used.
    - **FillFrame**: Specifies the image filling method when the camera for stream recording is turned off. If it is not specified, the default configuration is used.
    - **MaxIdleTime** and **MaxRecordTime**: Indicate the time configuration related to the automatic ending of recording tasks. If it is not specified, the default configuration is used.
    - **MixConfig**: The configuration related to mixed streams. The preset parameters in the request indicate that the split layout is used for images during mixed-stream recording and specify the output stream names and audio and video parameters. For more information, see [Grid layout](/cloud-recording/common-features/set-the-mixed-flow-layout#grid-layout) in "Set mixed-stream layout".
    - **RecordOutputParams**: The output parameters of the recording task. The preset values in the request indicate that MP4 media files are output to the **test** folder of the storage service.
    - **StorageParams**: The storage configuration of the recording task.  
    </Note>

    Modify the request parameters as required and perform the commissioning test. For more information about the parameters, see [Start recording](./Start%20Recording.mdx).

2. Click **Send** to check the response. If the error code in the response is not 0, modify the request based on the error description of the response and send the request again. Ensure that **TaskID** returned in the response is saved.
