# Integrate the SDK

---

## Prepare the environment

Before integrating the ZEGO Express SDK, ensure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Xcode 15.0 or later.
- iOS 12.0 or later with iOS devices or simulators that support audio (real devices are recommended).
- iOS devices are connected to the Internet.

## Integrate the SDK

### (Optional) Create a new project

<Accordion title="This step uses creating a new project as an example. If integrating into an existing project, ignore this step." defaultOpen="false">
1. Launch Xcode, click "Create a new Xcode project" in the "Welcome to Xcode" window, or select the "File > New > Project" menu. In the displayed form, select the iOS platform, and choose "App" under "Application".

2. Fill out the form and select various options to configure the project. After completion, click "Next".

    You must provide "Product Name" and "Organization Identifier" to create the unique identifier "Bundle Identifier" for the App.

### Import the SDK

Developers can integrate the SDK through any of the following methods.

#### Method 1: Use Swift Package Manager for automatic integration (recommended)

1. Open Xcode and click the menu bar "File > Add Packages...". In the "Search or Enter Package URL" input box of the "Apple Swift Packages" dialog, enter the following URL and press Enter to confirm:

    ```markdown
    https://github.com/zegolibrary/express-audio-ios
    ```

2. In "Dependency Rule", specify the SDK version you want to integrate (it is recommended to use the default "Up to Next Major Version"), then click "Add Package" to import the SDK. You can also refer to the [Apple official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) for settings.

#### Method 2: Use CocoaPods for automatic integration

<Accordion title="Use CocoaPods for automatic integration" defaultOpen="false">
1. Install CocoaPods. For common installation issues, please refer to [CocoaPods FAQ - Installing CocoaPods](https://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/CocoaPods_question?product=HybridHierarchicalDeliverySystem&platform=macos).

2. Open Terminal, navigate to the project root directory, and run the `pod init` command to create a Podfile file.

3. Open the Podfile file and add `pod 'ZegoExpressAudio'` under "target". You need to replace "MyProject" with your Target name.

<Warning title="Note">
    - Since the SDK is an XCFramework, CocoaPods v1.10.0 or later is required to integrate this SDK.
    - Starting from version v3.2.0, the Pod name for Express Video Call Video SDK has changed from `ZegoExpressEngine/Video` to `ZegoExpressEngine`; the Pod name for Express Audio Call Audio SDK has changed from `ZegoExpressEngine/Audio` to `ZegoExpressAudio`.
</Warning>



    ```ruby
    target 'MyProject' do
        use_frameworks!
        # Please enter the specific SDK version number
        # Please check the SDK latest version from the release notes and modify x.y.z to the specific version number
        pod 'ZegoExpressAudio', '~> x.y.z'
    end
    ```

4. Run the `pod repo update` command to update the local index to ensure the latest version of the SDK can be installed. For the latest version number, please refer to the release history in [Download SDK Package](/real-time-video-ios-oc/client-sdk/download-sdk).

5. Run the `pod install` command to install the SDK.

<Note title="Note">
    - If the "CDN: trunk URL couldn't be downloaded" issue occurs, please refer to [CocoaPods FAQ - Connection to trunk CDN issue](https://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/CocoaPods_question?product=ExpressVideo&platform=macos#2).
    - If the "Unable to find a specification for 'ZegoExpressEngine'" issue occurs, please refer to [CocoaPods FAQ - Unable to find project issue](https://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/CocoaPods_question?product=ExpressVideo&platform=macos#3).
    - If the "CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "ZegoExpressEngine"" issue occurs, please refer to [CocoaPods FAQ - Unable to find project issue](https://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/CocoaPods_question?product=ExpressVideo&platform=macos#3).
</Note>

#### Method 3: Manually integrate by copying SDK files

<Accordion title="Manually integrate by copying SDK files" defaultOpen="false">
1. Please refer to [Download SDK Package](/real-time-video-ios-oc/client-sdk/download-sdk) to download the latest version of the SDK and extract it.

2. Manually copy the SDK dynamic library file "ZegoExpressEngine.xcframework" to your project directory.

  <Accordion title="XCFramework file description" defaultOpen="false">
**XCFramework** is a new packaging form that includes multiple platform architectures such as real devices and simulators at the same time. Please integrate it as a **whole** into the project. It is not recommended to split it for use. However, if you indeed **only need** to integrate the real device architecture separately, or integrate the simulator architecture separately, you can also extract the **.framework** inside the **XCFramework** for separate use.

    - ios-arm64: Suitable for iOS real devices.
    - ios-arm64_x86_64-maccatalyst: Suitable for **Mac Catalyst** package on macOS. **Mac Catalyst** is a new framework launched by Apple in 2019, namely **UIKit for Mac**, designed to let iPad Apps run on macOS. For details, please refer to [Apple Developer - Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst)
    - ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator: Suitable for iOS simulators.
</Accordion>

3. Open Xcode, select the "File > Add Files to "xxx" (xxx is the project name)" menu, and add the SDK library file to the project.
