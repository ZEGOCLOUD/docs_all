# Server-side stream mixing pricing

---

## Usage statistics

The usage of stream mixing services is calculated based on the duration of stream mixing and transcoding. Developers can specify multiple audio streams for mixing.

- Calculated based on the actual audio duration output through the stream mixing service.
- Audio streams for mixing need to be published to the stream mixing server first, which will incur real-time audio stream fees.
- Supports specifying a single audio stream for mixing.

<Note title="Notes">


**Precision description:**
 - Duration usage precision is in seconds. When billing, the cumulative seconds within a billing cycle are converted into minutes for statistics. Any part of a minute is counted as one minute, and billing is ultimately based on the number of minutes.

**Mixing description:**

 - Calculated based on the duration from the start of stream mixing and transcoding to the end of stream mixing and transcoding.
 - If multiple mixed audio outputs are output simultaneously, usage needs to be aggregated for statistics.
