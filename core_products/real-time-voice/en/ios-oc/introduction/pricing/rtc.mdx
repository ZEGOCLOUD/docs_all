# Real-time Voice pricing

---

## Usage statistics

The usage of real-time audio services is calculated based on the duration during which users actually play audio streams.

- If users do not play audio or video streams in the room, no fees are charged.
- When an audio and video stream played by a user contains both video stream data and audio stream data, only the video duration is counted once, and the audio duration will not be calculated separately.

<Note title="Notes">
**Precision description:**
 - Duration usage precision is in seconds. When billing, the cumulative seconds within a billing cycle are converted into minutes for statistics. Any part of a minute is counted as one minute, and billing is ultimately based on the number of minutes.

**Playing stream description:**
 - Audio playing refers to users obtaining "audio data streams" through clients (or other terminals).
 - Calculated based on the duration from when the user starts playing the stream to when the user stops playing the stream.

## Billing examples

### Interactive room

Assume users A and B stay in the same room for 20 minutes. Both A and B do not receive video screens and only play each other's high-quality audio only streams, meaning A plays B's audio stream, and B plays A's audio stream.

Fee calculation:

|Billing tier|Billing formula|Calculation example|Fee (CNY)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High-quality audio only|High-quality audio only duration unit price × Sum of high-quality audio only stream durations played by all users| 7.00 x (20 + 20) / 1,000 |0.28|

The **total real-time audio fee** generated by this room is 0.28 CNY.
