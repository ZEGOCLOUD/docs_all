## Sample Source Code Running Guide

### Prepare Environment

Before integrating the ZEGO Express SDK, please ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), it is recommended to use the Long Term Support (LTS) version displayed on the official website homepage.

2. Install a browser with compatibility as shown in the following table:

<Warning title="Note">


Only Web servers with **SSL** (**https**), **localhost**, **127.0.0.1** are equivalent to **https**.

</Warning>



### Prerequisites

You have created a project in the [ZEGO Console](https://console-express.zego.im/account/login), applied for a valid AppID and AppSign, and obtained the access server address Server. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Management](/console-old/project-management).


### Notes

- The SDK in the sample source code is a beta version, please do not use it in a production environment.
- ZEGO currently only provides an interface for obtaining tokens in a test environment. In a production environment, developers need to implement the token acquisition logic themselves. For obtaining the token required for logging into a room, please refer to [Login Room Authentication](/real-time-video-web/communication/using-token-authentication).

### Run Sample Source Code

1. Switch to the project directory in Terminal and run the `npm i` command to install dependencies.

2. The downloaded sample source code lacks the appId and server address required for SDK initialization. You need to modify the appId and server in the "./src/common.js" file to the AppID and Server obtained in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), otherwise the sample source code cannot run normally.

3. Run the `npm run dev` command in Terminal to run the sample source code. After running successfully, access the local server (https://***) in a browser. An example is as follows:

​    &emsp;Project is running at https://192.168.6.184:9090/

<Note title="Note">

Run the `Control+C` command in Terminal to stop the server.

</Note>




### Experience Real-time Audio/Video Features

Run the project on a real device. After running successfully, you can hear the local audio and see the local video.

Use the [Web Debug Sample](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html) (only supports use in a test environment), enter the same AppID and roomID, and join the same room to communicate with the real device. When the audio/video call starts successfully, you can hear both local and remote audio, and see both local and remote video.

<Note title="Note">

In audio-only scenarios, you can only hear audio and cannot see video.
