### Import SDK

1. Download SDK.

Please download the SDK package from [Download SDK Package](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/client-sdk/download-sdk).

2. Unzip the SDK package and copy it to the project directory.

The SDK package contains two directories: "include" and "lib". Each directory contains files described as follows:

```cpp
include    --------------- Include SDK header files
lib        --------------- Contains SDK's .lib and .dll files
    | x86   --------------- 32-bit version
    | x64   --------------- 64-bit version
```
```

## Set Project Properties

1. In the Solution Resource Manager window, right-click on the project name, click "Properties". This enters the project properties page.

2. Within the project properties page, perform the following configuration, and click "OK" after completion:

1. Add the include directory to the header file search path.
   - Select "Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories" menu, then click the ellipsis button (...) to add the include directory.
   - In the popup dialog, select "Include directory" as "C/C++", enter the include directory path (e.g., "include"), and click "OK".

2. Select "Configuration Properties > Linker > Input" menu. In the "Additional Dependencies" field, select "Additional Library Directories", and enter the following path:
   - Select "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories", enter the lib directory path (e.g., "lib"). Then select "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories" menu again to add the lib directory to the library search path.

3. Link the ZegoExpressEngine.lib.

Select "Configuration Properties > Linker > Input" menu. In the "Additional Dependencies" field, select "Additional Library Directories", enter "lib" to add the lib directory to the library search path. Then select "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories" menu again to add the lib directory path.

## Additional Steps (Optional)

Add include directory to header file search path and add lib directory to library search path.
Select "Configuration Properties > Linker > Input" menu. In the "Additional Dependencies" field, select "Additional Library Directories", enter the lib directory path (e.g., "lib"). Then select "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories" menu again to add the lib directory path to the library search path.
