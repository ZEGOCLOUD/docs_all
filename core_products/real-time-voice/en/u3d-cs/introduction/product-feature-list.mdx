| [CDN Stream Publishing Authentication](/real-time-voice-u3d/live-streaming/cdn-stream-publishing-authentication) | To prevent attackers from stealing your publishing URL for unauthorized stream publishing or forging your server to generate publish URLs (resulting in traffic loss), you can configure CDN publishing authentication via the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/). When enabled, authentication parameters must be appended to the publishing URL; otherwise, publishing fails. | - |
| [Play stream by URL](/real-time-voice-u3d/live-streaming/playing-stream-by-url) | When the stream is published to CDN using a third-party tool (such as OBS or IP Camera), or using ZEGOCLOUD SDK’s re-publish-to-CDN feature, streams can be played by directly passing the URL. | Obtain third-party live streaming content |
