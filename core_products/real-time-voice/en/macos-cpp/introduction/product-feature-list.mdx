## Live Streaming Capabilities

### Basic Features

| Basic Feature-20% | Feature Description-50% | Business Scenario-30% |

| Stream Mixing | Multiple video streams from different users are mixed into one, so viewers only need to subscribe to a single stream to see and hear all members in the room. | Multi-person call, co-host live streaming  |
| Live Streaming via CDN | Integrates capabilities from multiple CDN vendors, supporting directly pushing to CDN, bridging RTC and CDN streaming products, making it convenient for users to watch streams via web or third-party players. | Basic live streaming with high concurrency, scenarios with no strict requirements on live delay |
| CDN Push Authentication | To prevent attackers from stealing your CDN stream push URL for unauthorized use, or from forging URLs via your server, you can use [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im/) to enable CDN push authentication. When enabled, relevant authentication parameters must be appended to the push URL, otherwise streaming is not allowed. | - |
| Pull Stream via URL | When the push end uses a third-party tool (like OBS, IP Camera, etc.) to stream to CDN, or ZEGO SDK is used to relay a stream to a third-party CDN, you can pull the stream using the URL directly. | Obtain third-party live video content   |
