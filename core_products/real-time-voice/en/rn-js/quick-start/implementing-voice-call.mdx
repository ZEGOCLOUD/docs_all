# Implementing Voice Call

---



## Introduction

This document introduces how to quickly implement a simple real-time audio and video call.

Explanation of related concepts:

- ZEGO Express SDK: A real-time audio and video SDK provided by ZEGO, offering developers convenient access, high definition and fluency, multi-platform interoperability, low latency, and high concurrency audio and video services.
- Stream: A set of audio and video data packets encapsulated in a specified encoding format and continuously being sent. A user can publish multiple streams simultaneously (for example, one for camera data and one for screen sharing data) and can also play multiple streams simultaneously. Each stream is identified by a stream ID (streamID).
- Publish stream: The process of pushing packaged audio and video data streams to the ZEGO real-time audio and video cloud.
- Play stream: The process of pulling and playing existing audio and video data streams from the ZEGO real-time audio and video cloud.
- Room: An audio and video space service provided by ZEGO, used to organize user groups. Users in the same room can send and receive real-time audio, video, and messages to each other.
    1. Users need to log in to a room first before they can publish or play streams.
    2. Users can only receive related messages in the room they are in (user entry/exit, audio and video stream changes, etc.).
    3. Each room is identified by a unique roomID within an AppID. All users who log in to the room using the same roomID belong to the same room.



For more related concepts, please refer to [Glossary](/glossary/term-explanation).

## Prerequisites

Before implementing basic audio call functionality, please ensure:

- The ZEGO Express SDK has been integrated in your project to implement basic real-time audio and video functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integrate](/real-time-voice-rn/quick-start/integrating-sdk).
- A project has been created in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com), and a valid AppID and AppSign have been obtained. For details, please refer to "Project Information" in [Console - Project Management](/console/project-info).

<Warning title="Note">


The SDK also supports Token authentication. If you have higher security requirements for your project, it is recommended to upgrade the authentication method. For details, please refer to [How to upgrade from AppSign authentication to Token authentication](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/faq/token_upgrade?product=ExpressVideo).

</Warning>





## Usage Steps

Taking User A playing User B's stream as an example, the process is as follows:

<a id="CreateEngine"> </a>

### Create Engine

**1. Create Engine**

Call the [createEngineWithProfile](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#createenginewithprofile) interface and pass the obtained AppID and AppSign to the parameters "appID" and "appSign" to create the engine.

<Warning title="Note">


The SDK also supports Token authentication. If you need to upgrade the authentication method, please refer to [How to upgrade from AppSign authentication to Token authentication](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/faq/token_upgrade?product=ExpressVideo).

</Warning>




```javascript
// Import
import ZegoExpressEngine from 'zego-express-engine-reactnative';

// Use general scenario
const profile = {
appID : xxx,
// AppSign only meets simple authentication requirements. If you need to upgrade to a more secure authentication method, please refer to [How to upgrade from AppSign authentication to Token authentication](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/faq/token_upgrade?product=ExpressVideo&platform=all)
// AppSign can be obtained through the [Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/dashboard), format: @"39011cbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
appSign: '39011cbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
scenario : 0
};

ZegoExpressEngine.createEngineWithProfile(profile)
```

**2. Disable Camera**

<Warning title="Note">


The Express React Native SDK does not provide an audio-only package with the video module removed. Therefore, the React Native "Real-time Voice" SDK is actually the "Real-time Audio and Video" SDK.


</Warning>



To implement an audio-only scenario, please call [enableCamera](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#enablecamera) after creating the engine to disable the camera, to avoid starting the engine's video module. After the camera is disabled, camera permissions will no longer be required, and video streams will not be published.

```js
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().enableCamera(false); // Disable camera
```

For more information, please refer to the document [Differences between Real-time Audio and Video SDK and Real-time Voice SDK](/real-time-voice-rn/introduction/difference-between-audio-and-video-sdk).

If you have high requirements for the Express React Native SDK package size, you can contact Technical Support for custom package reduction. For SDK package size data, please refer to the [Overview](/real-time-voice-rn/introduction/overview) document.

**3. Set Callbacks**

After creating the engine, you can register callbacks through the [on](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#on) method of the engine instance.

<Warning title="Note">


To avoid missing event notifications, it is recommended to register callbacks immediately after creating the engine.

</Warning>





<a id="loginRoom"></a>
### Log In to Room

**1. Log In**

Create a ZegoUser user object by passing in the user ID parameter "userID", then call the [loginRoom](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#loginroom) interface, pass in the room ID parameter "roomID" and user parameter "user", to log in to the room. If the room does not exist, calling this interface will create and log in to this room.

- Within the same AppID, ensure that "roomID" is globally unique.
- Within the same AppID, ensure that "userID" is globally unique. It is recommended that developers set it to a meaningful value and associate "userID" with their own business account system.


```javascript
let roomConfig = {};
// If you use appsign for authentication, the token parameter does not need to be filled; if you need to use a more secure authentication method: token authentication, please refer to [How to upgrade from AppSign authentication to Token authentication](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/faq/token_upgrade?product=ExpressVideo&platform=all)
// roomConfig.token = "xxxx";
// Only by passing in a ZegoRoomConfig with the "isUserStatusNotify" parameter set to "true" can you receive the onRoomUserUpdate callback.
roomConfig.isUserStatusNotify = true;
// Log in to room
// Start logging in to the room
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().loginRoom('room1', {'userID': 'id1', 'userName': 'user1'}, roomConfig);
```

**2. Listen for event callbacks after logging in to the room

According to actual application needs, you can listen for event notifications you care about after logging in to the room, such as room status updates, user status updates, stream status updates, etc.
- [roomStateUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomstateupdate): Room status update callback. After logging in to the room, when the room connection status changes (such as room disconnection, authentication failure, etc.), the SDK will notify through this callback.
- [roomUserUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomuserupdate): User status update callback. After logging in to the room, when users are added to or removed from the room, the SDK will notify through this callback.

    Users can receive the [roomUserUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomuserupdate) callback only when calling the [loginRoom](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#loginroom) interface to log in to the room with the [ZegoRoomConfig](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressdefines_.zegoroomconfig.html) configuration, and the "isUserStatusNotify" parameter is set to "true".

- [roomStreamUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomstreamupdate): Stream status update callback. After logging in to the room, when users in the room newly publish or remove audio and video streams, the SDK will notify through this callback.

<Warning title="Note">


- Users can receive the [roomUserUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomuserupdate) callback only when calling the [loginRoom](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#loginroom) interface to log in to the room with the [ZegoRoomConfig](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressdefines_.zegoroomconfig.html) configuration, and the "isUserStatusNotify" parameter is set to "true".
- Normally, if a user wants to play videos published by other users, they can call the [startPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#startplayingstream) interface in the stream status update (addition) callback to pull the remote published audio and video streams.

</Warning>




```javascript
// The following are common room-related callbacks

ZegoExpressEngine.instance().on('roomStateUpdate', (roomID, state, errorCode, extendedData) => {
  // Room status update callback. After logging in to the room, when the room connection status changes (such as room disconnection, authentication failure, etc.), the SDK will notify through this callback
}); ;


ZegoExpressEngine.instance().on('roomUserUpdate', (roomID, updateType, userList) => {
  // User status update. After logging in to the room, when users are added to or removed from the room, the SDK will notify through this callback
});

ZegoExpressEngine.instance().on('roomStreamUpdate', (roomID, updateType, streamList) => {
  // Stream status update. After logging in to the room, when users in the room newly publish or remove audio and video streams, the SDK will notify through this callback
});
```

<a id="publishingStream"></a>

### Publish Stream

**1. Start Publishing Stream**

Call the [startPublishingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#startpublishingstream) interface, pass in the stream ID parameter "streamID", to send the local audio and video stream to remote users.

<Warning title="Note">


Within the same AppID, ensure that "streamID" is globally unique. If within the same AppID, different users each publish a stream with the same "streamID", it will cause the user who publishes later to fail to publish the stream.

</Warning>



```javascript
/** Start publishing stream */
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().startPublishingStream("streamID");
```

**2. Listen for event callbacks after publishing stream**

According to actual application needs, listen for event notifications you care about after publishing stream, such as publishing status updates, etc.

[PublisherStateUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#publisherstateupdate): Publishing status update callback. After the publishing interface is called successfully, when the publishing status changes, such as network interruption causing publishing exceptions, etc., the SDK will notify through this callback while retrying to publish.

```javascript
    ZegoExpressEngine.instance().on("PublisherStateUpdate", (streamID, state, errorCode, extendedData) => {
    // After the publishing interface is called successfully, when the publisher status changes, such as network interruption causing publishing exceptions, etc., the SDK will notify through this callback while retrying to publish
    //....
});
```


### Play Stream

**1. Start Playing Stream**

Call the [startPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#startplayingstream) interface, based on the passed stream ID parameter "streamID", to pull the remote published audio and video streams.

The "streamID" published by remote users can be obtained from the [onRoomStreamUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomstreamupdate) callback.

<Warning title="Note">


Ensure that "streamID" is globally unique.


</Warning>



```javascript

// Start playing stream
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().startPlayingStream("streamID");
```

**2. Listen for event callbacks after playing stream**

According to actual application needs, listen for event notifications you care about after playing stream, such as playing status updates, etc.

[PlayerStateUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#playerstateupdate): Playing status update callback. After the playing interface is called successfully, when the playing status changes, such as network interruption causing publishing exceptions, etc., the SDK will notify through this callback while retrying to play.

```javascript
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().on("PlayerStateUpdate", (streamID, state, errorCode, extendedData) => {
    /** After the playing interface is called successfully, when the player status changes, such as network interruption causing publishing exceptions, etc., the SDK will notify through this callback while retrying to play */
    //....
});
```

### Experience Real-time Audio and Video Functions

Run the project on a real device. After successful operation, you can see the local video screen.

For convenience, ZEGO provides a [Web Debugging Example](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html). On this page, enter the same AppID and RoomID, enter different UserIDs and the corresponding [Token](/console/development-assistance/temporary-token), and you can join the same room to communicate with real devices. When the audio and video call starts successfully, you can hear remote audio and see the remote video screen.

<a id="stopPublishingStream"></a>

### Stop Publishing and Playing Streams

**1. Stop Publishing Stream**

Call the [stopPublishingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#stoppublishingstream) interface to stop sending local audio and video streams and end the call.

```javascript
/** Stop publishing stream */
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().stopPublishingStream();
```

**2. Stop Playing Stream**

Call the [stopPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#stopplayingstream) interface to stop pulling remote audio and video streams.

<Warning title="Note">


If the developer receives a "decrease" notification for audio and video streams through the [roomStreamUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomstreamupdate) callback, please call the [stopPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#stopplayingstream) interface in time to stop playing streams, to avoid pulling empty streams and generating additional costs; or, developers can choose the appropriate timing according to their business needs and proactively call the [stopPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#stopplayingstream) interface to stop playing streams.

</Warning>




```javascript
// Stop playing stream
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().stopPlayingStream("streamID");
```


**3. Log Out of Room**

Call the [logoutRoom](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#logoutroom) interface to log out of the room. The local side will receive the [onRoomStateUpdate](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomstateupdate) callback notification of the call result, and stop all publishing and playing streams as well as local preview.

```javascript
// Log out of room
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().logoutRoom('room1');
```

### Destroy Engine

Call the [destroyEngine](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#destroyengine) interface to destroy the engine, used to release resources used by the SDK.

```javascript
ZegoExpressEngine.destroyEngine();
```

<Note title="Note">


According to actual needs, you can use the "await" keyword when destroying the engine to asynchronously wait to ensure that device hardware resources are released.

</Note>
