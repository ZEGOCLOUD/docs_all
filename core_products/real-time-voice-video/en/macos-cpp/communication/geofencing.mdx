# Geofencing

- - -

## Feature Overview

Geofencing refers to restricting the transmission of audio, video, and signaling data to a specific region to comply with regional data privacy and security regulations, that is, limiting access to video call services in a specific region. For example, when the specified geofencing region is Europe, regardless of where the App users are located, the region actually accessed by the SDK will be Europe.

<td>May be significantly affected</td>
</tr>

<Warning title="Attention">

- If all servers in the specified geofencing region are unavailable, the SDK will directly report an error.
- Due to the cross-region public internet between the specified geofencing region and the App user's region, poor public internet quality will affect the audio and video experience.

|Mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan|CN|
|North America|NA|
|India|IN|
|Europe|EU|
|Asia, excluding Mainland China and India|AS|

## Prerequisites

Before using the geofencing feature, ensure that:
- A project has been created in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and valid AppID and AppSign have been obtained. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- ZEGO Express SDK has been integrated into your project and basic audio and video streaming functions have been implemented. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-macos-cpp/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-macos-cpp/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Implementation Flow

### Enable Geofencing Permission

Geofencing capability may require payment in some cases. Please contact ZEGO sales to confirm and enable geofencing permissions.


### Set Geofencing

- Geofencing information: Includes geofencing type and geofencing region list.
- Geofencing type: Includes two types: Include and Exclude. The geofencing type will apply to the geofencing region list.
    - Include: Indicates that all regions in the region list are included within the geofencing.
    - Exclude: Indicates that all regions in the region list are excluded from the geofencing.

Before creating the SDK, call the [setGeoFence](@setGeoFence) interface to set geofencing information.

<Warning title="Attention">



Please configure geofencing information before calling [createEngine](@createEngine), otherwise it will be invalid.

</Warning>




```cpp
// Example of setting Include mode
//Set Include mode
ZegoGeoFenceType  type = ZegoGeoFenceType::ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_TYPE_INCLUDE;
// Set region list information, at least 1, at most not more than the number supported by the SDK
std::vector<int> areaList;
areaList.push_back((int)ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode::ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_CN);
areaList.push_back((int)ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode::ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_NA);
// This interface is a static method, called before createEngine
ZegoExpressSDK::setGeoFence(type, areaList);

// Example of setting Exclude mode
//Set Exclude mode
ZegoGeoFenceType  type = ZegoGeoFenceType::ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_TYPE_EXCLUDE;

// Set region list information, at least 1, at most not more than the number supported by the SDK
std::vector<int> areaList;
areaList.push_back((int)ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode::ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_CN);
areaList.push_back((int)ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode::ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_NA);
// This interface is a static method, called before createEngine
ZegoExpressSDK::setGeoFence(type, areaList);
```

### Integrate Other Features

After completing the geofencing settings, you can proceed with integrating other features.
