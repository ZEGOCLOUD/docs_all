# Upgrade Guide for Version 3.8.0 and Above

---

<Warning title="Attention">
- If your current SDK version is lower than 3.8.0 and you need to upgrade to any SDK version 3.8.0 or above, please read this document carefully.
- Additionally, it is recommended that you refer to the [Release Notes](/real-time-video-macos-cpp/client-sdk/release-notes) based on your **current version number** and **target upgrade version number** to check the changes between the two versions and review the interfaces related to your business.

</Warning>



In version 3.8.0, the naming of one API interface in the media data publisher class [IZegoMediaDataPublisher](@-IZegoMediaDataPublisher) was changed: the original member function `setMediaDataPublisherEventHandler` was renamed to [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler).

## Compilation Errors

After successfully upgrading from a version prior to 3.8.0, compilation errors may occur and adaptation is required.

```sh
error: no member named 'setMediaDataPublisherEventHandler' in 'ZEGO::EXPRESS::IZegoMediaDataPublisher'
    publisher->setMediaDataPublisherEventHandler(shared_from_this());
    ~~~~~~~~~  ^
1 error generated.
```
