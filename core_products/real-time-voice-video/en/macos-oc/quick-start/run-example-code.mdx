# Running Example Source Code

---

## macOS Sample Code

To run the macOS Objective-C sample source code, refer to the following two methods:
- **Method 1**: (Recommended) Refer to the [macOS Swift](/real-time-video-macos-swift/quick-start/run-example-code) sample code.
- **Method 2**: Refer to the [iOS Objective-C](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/run-example-code) sample code. (The interfaces of Express macOS SDK and Express iOS SDK are basically consistent)

<Note title="Note">

If you need to use C++ interfaces, please refer to the [Running Example Source Code](/real-time-video-macos-cpp/quick-start/run-example-code) documentation for macOS C++.
</Note>

## Mac Catalyst Sample Code

To obtain the Mac Catalyst sample code, please download the [iOS Objective-C](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/run-example-code) sample code. The Xcode project included contains the Mac Catalyst Target.
