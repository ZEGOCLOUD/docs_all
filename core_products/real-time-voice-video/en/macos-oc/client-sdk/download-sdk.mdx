- If you need to use the SDK with "whiteboard features", you can download the "Interactive Whiteboard SDK" from [Interactive Whiteboard - Download SDK](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/6213). This SDK already includes the ZegoExpress-Video SDK (with whiteboard features), so there is no need to download it separately.
