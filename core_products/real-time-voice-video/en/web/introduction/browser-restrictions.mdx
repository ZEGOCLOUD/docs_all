# Browser compatibility and known issues

- - -
## Overview

WebRTC is a JavaScript API that supports web browsers for real-time voice or video calls and real-time data transmission (Web Real-Time Communication).

ZEGO Express Web SDK uses WebRTC technology to implement Video Call features. Therefore, whether the Web SDK can be used in the current browser depends on the browser's compatibility with WebRTC. Currently, WebRTC is well supported on desktop browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, as well as mobile Safari browsers. This article will introduce the browser compatibility for desktop and mobile platforms respectively.

<Warning title="Note">

Due to platform differences and variations in built-in browsers for applications, we cannot cover all browsers. Browsers not listed in the following documentation do not necessarily indicate lack of support. If you have questions, please contact ZEGO Technical Support.

</Warning>





## Desktop

### Browser compatibility

Currently, the browsers and versions supported by ZEGO Express Web SDK on desktop are as follows:

<Warning title="Note">


WebRTC technology is best supported on the Chrome platform. It is recommended that developers use the latest version of [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/intlhttps://doc-zh.zego.im/article-CN/chrome/) and download the latest version of [Web SDK](/real-time-video-web/client-sdk/download-sdk).

## Mobile

### Android

#### Browser compatibility

Since the native WebView on the Android platform can be customized, WebView implementations may vary across different platforms, devices, and applications. The support for ZEGO Express Web SDK on Android is as follows:

<Warning title="Note">


Since different mobile phone manufacturers may modify their browser kernels to varying degrees, we cannot guarantee that built-in browsers will support WebRTC well. It is recommended that developers use Chrome browser.

</Warning>



| Operating system | Browser | Play stream | Publish stream | Screen sharing |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Android | Chrome browser | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✖ |
| !mu | Firefox browser | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✖ |
| !mu | QQ browser | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✖ |
| !mu | UC browser | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ |
| !mu | WeChat built-in browser (TBS kernel) | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✖ |
| !mu | WeChat built-in browser (XWEB kernel) | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✖ |
| !mu | WeCom built-in browser | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✖ |



#### Compatibility limitations

The compatibility limitations of Web SDK on Android are as follows:

| Browser | Limitations |
|--------|------|
| All browsers/application embedded WebViews (such as WeChat built-in browser, QQ browser, UC browser, etc.) | <ul><li>**Screen sharing**: Screen sharing is not supported.</li><li>**device label**: On some Android devices, the device label of media devices may not be obtainable.</li><li>**Compatibility note**: Browser compatibility is related to browser version, running kernel, device chip, etc. ZEGO strongly recommends developers to perform compatibility testing before use.</li><li>**Camera switching**: Some Android devices do not support using front and rear cameras simultaneously. You can enable the `stopTrackWhenSwitchDevice` configuration through [setEngineConfig](/real-time-video-web/client-sdk/api-reference/class#setengineconfig) to work around this. For details, please contact ZEGO Technical Support.</li> <li>**Device occupation**: When multiple pages use the same camera and microphone, the video and audio of the current or previous pages will be muted by the system and cannot be recovered. You can listen for error codes 1106011 and 1106012 of the deviceError event, remind users in the UI to close other pages and re-enter the room to restore video and audio (supported in version 3.8.140 and above).</li> </ul> |
| Chrome | **Encoding format**: <ul><li>On some Android devices (such as Huawei), Chrome browser does not support H.264 encoding format.</li><li>Chrome 136 and above with hardware acceleration support can support H.265 encoding format.</li></ul> |
| Firefox | **Video image**: When using Web SDK on Firefox to communicate with some devices, the remote image you see may be rotated. |


Some Android devices do not support H.264 encoding. Developers can detect through the [checkSystemRequirements](/real-time-video-web/client-sdk/api-reference/class#checksystemrequirements) interface. If the current device does not support this encoding format, you can use "VP8" encoding. At the same time, some browsers do not support WebRTC technology. It is recommended that developers use Chrome browser.


### iOS

#### Browser compatibility

Currently, all application built-in WebViews on the iOS platform can only use the system-provided ones, which has certain limitations.

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All browsers/application embedded webviews | <ul><li>**Screen sharing**: Screen sharing is not supported.</li><li>**Publish stream**: When publishing audio and video streams on iOS, after being interrupted by other applications, the video stream sending cannot be automatically recovered, and you need to re-capture and re-publish the stream.</li><li>**Audio routing switching**: On iOS 17, if you use non-Apple original Bluetooth headphones to play audio while capturing audio and video, the sound that would normally come from the Bluetooth headphones will come from the device's speakers. It is recommended to specify the deviceId when capturing audio and video to work around this issue.</li><li>**Device occupation**: When multiple pages use the same camera and microphone, the previous video and audio will be muted by the system and cannot be recovered. You can listen for error codes 1106011 and 1106012 of the deviceError event, remind users in the UI to close other pages and re-enter the room to restore video and audio (supported in version 3.8.140 and above).</li></ul> |

### HarmonyOS

#### Browser compatibility

Currently, the HarmonyOS system needs to be upgraded to HarmonyOS NEXT 5.0 or a higher version, and you need to use the Huawei browser to use WebRTC audio and video publish/play streams.

| Operating system                | Browser     | Version compatibility  | Receive (Play) | Send (Publish) | Screen sharing |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Version >= NEXT 5.0       | Huawei browser | -           | ✔️           | ✔️           | ✖        |

#### Compatibility limitations

The compatibility limitations of Web SDK on HarmonyOS Huawei browser are as follows:

| Browser      | Limitations |
|-----------|------|
| Huawei browser | <ul><li><b>Encoding format</b>: Supports H.264 and VP8 encoding formats. H.264 encoding format has a lower bitrate.</li><li><b>Media track</b>: When calling the browser's "getUserMedia" interface for the second time to obtain video tracks, you must stop the first obtained media track at the same time.</li><li><b>Sound capture</b>: After connecting an external microphone, audio capture will use the external microphone and cannot be switched to the phone's built-in microphone.</li><li><b>Audio routing switching</b>: Audio routing switching means that when other audio applications (such as MeeTime) interrupt audio playback, after returning to the browser, the played stream sound only comes from the receiver.</li><li><b>Capture audio and video</b>: Answering a phone call will interrupt audio and video capture and playback. In this case, you need to manually resume playback.</li></ul> |

## Browser compatibility detection

### Integration detection

Developers can use the [checkSystemRequirements](/real-time-video-web/client-sdk/api-reference/class#checksystemrequirements) interface provided by ZEGO Express Web SDK to detect the compatibility of the current browser. This interface can detect WebRTC, video encoding, custom capture, camera, microphone, and screen sharing support.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
// The returned result is the compatibility detection result. When webRTC is true, it means WebRTC is supported. For the meaning of other attributes, please refer to the interface API documentation.
console.log(result);
// {
//   webRTC: true,
//   customCapture: true,
//   camera: true,
//   microphone: true,
//   videoCodec: { H264: true, H265: false, VP8: true, VP9: true },
//   screenSharing: true,
//   errInfo: {}
// }
```

### Online detection

ZEGO provides an [online detection tool](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/webrtcCheck/index.html) to help developers automatically detect whether the device browser can normally run WebRTC applications.

This tool supports detecting the following items:

* Browser compatibility
* Device acquisition capability
* H264 video encoding detection
* H265 video encoding detection
* VP8 video encoding detection
* Whether speaker playback is normal
* What resolutions the current device can support

The online detection tool automatically detects whether the browser supports the current voice and video call by calling the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface. The following will explain its principle item by item.

<Accordion title="WebRTC detection" defaultOpen="false">
Web SDK implements audio and video communication based on WebRTC, so WebRTC detection is essential.

In the online detection page, the detection result object is obtained through the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface. There is a `webRTC` item in the object, which is used to detect whether the current page supports basic WebRTC capabilities. If the returned result is "true", it means WebRTC is supported; if the result is "false", it means it is not supported, and Web SDK cannot be used normally.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
console.log(result.webRTC)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Get devices" defaultOpen="false">
Get the device list through the `zg.enumDevices` interface. The device list includes device IDs, labels, etc. for cameras, microphones, and speakers. Developers can determine whether the current page has the ability to obtain device information by the length of the device list.

```javascript
const devicesInfo = await zg.enumDevices();
console.log(devicesInfo);
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="H.264 video encoding detection" defaultOpen="false">
Get compatibility with H264 through the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface. A returned result of "true" means the current page supports H264 encoding; a result of "false" means it is not supported, and if not supported, there may be interoperability issues.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
console.log(result.videoCodec.H264)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="H.265 video encoding detection" defaultOpen="false">
Get compatibility with H265 through the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface. A returned result of "true" means the current page supports H265 encoding; a result of "false" means it is not supported, and if not supported, there may be interoperability issues.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
console.log(result.videoCodec.H265)
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="VP8 video encoding detection" defaultOpen="false">
Get support for VP8 through the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface. A returned result of "true" means the current page supports VP8 encoding; a result of "false" means it is not supported, and if not supported, there may be interoperability issues.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
console.log(result.videoCodec.VP8)
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Microphone detection" defaultOpen="false">
Detect whether the microphone sound can be normally captured through the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface.

Developers can obtain the microphone device list through the `zg.enumDevices()` interface and get the corresponding microphone device ID and label. If the parameter "microphone" in the detection result is "true" and the length of the microphone device list in the enumerated device list is greater than 0, it means the current page supports microphone capture.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
console.log(result.microphone);

const devicesInfo = await zg.enumDevices();
console.log(devicesInfo.microphones);
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Speaker detection" defaultOpen="false">
Play a piece of music through the HTML5 audio component, and after the user clicks to play, confirm whether the playing sound is heard.</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Camera detection" defaultOpen="false">
Determine whether the current page supports camera capture through the `zg.checkSystemRequirements` interface.

Developers can obtain the camera device list through `zg.enumDevices` and get the corresponding camera device ID and label. If the parameter "camera" in the detection result is "true" and the length of the camera device list in the enumerated device list is greater than 0, it means the current page supports camera capture.

```javascript
const result = await zg.checkSystemRequirements();
console.log(result.camera);

const devicesInfo = await zg.enumDevices();
console.log(devicesInfo.cameras);
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Resolution detection" defaultOpen="false">
Create a video stream through the `zg.createZegoStream` interface based on different resolution parameters.

Developers can obtain the video resolution through `videoTrack.getSettings`. If the obtained resolution is the same as the parameter, the test passes; otherwise, it indicates that it is not supported.

```javascript
const zegoLocalStream = await zg.createZegoStream({
    camera: {
        video: {
            width,
            height
        }
    }
});

const settings = zegoLocalStream.stream.getVideoTracks()[0].getSettings();
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connectivity detection" defaultOpen="false">
Call the `zg.createZegoStream` interface to create a stream, and call the `zg.startPublishingStream` interface to connect to the ZEGO server and start publishing to detect the availability of the current network link.

If it indicates not supported, please check the current network status or contact ZEGO Technical Support.

```javascript
const zegoLocalStream = await zg.createZegoStream();
zg.startPublishingStream('streamID', zegoLocalStream);

zg.on("publisherStateUpdate", result => {
    console.log('publisherStateUpdate: ', result.streamID, result.state);

    if (result.state == 'PUBLISHING') {
        console.info(' publish  success ' + result.streamID);
    }
})
```
