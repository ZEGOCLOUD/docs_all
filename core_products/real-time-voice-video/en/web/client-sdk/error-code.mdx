# Common Error codes

- - -

## Introduction


When the SDK encounters errors related to network or media issues, the SDK cannot recover automatically and requires App intervention or user notification. If error information exists in the return result after calling an interface, error information exists in event callbacks, or error logs appear in console logs, it indicates an exception in the interface call.

- Example code for error information returned after calling an interface:

```js
const { errorCode, extendedData } = await zg.setCaptureVolume(stream, result);
// errorCode is the error code, extendedData is the error description
console.log(errorCode, extendedData);
```

- Example code for error information thrown after calling an interface:

```js
try {
    await zg.setCaptureVolume(stream, result);
} catch (error) {
    // errorCode is the error code, extendedData is the error description
    const { errorCode, extendedData } = error;
    console.log(errorCode, extendedData);
}
```

- Example code for error information in event callbacks:

```js
zg.on('roomStateChanged', (roomID, reason, errorCode, extendedData) => {
    if (errorCode !== 0) {
      // errorCode is the error code, extendedData is the error description
      console.log(errorCode, extendedData);
    }
})
```

## 1000xxx/1100xxx Common Error codes

Common error codes are for general interface errors, usually occurring when calling [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) and [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStream) interfaces. Please handle them according to the following error codes.

## 1003xxx/1103xxx Stream Publishing Related Error codes

After calling the Stream publishing interface, or if an exception occurs during Stream publishing, developers can obtain relevant error codes from the [publisherStateUpdate](@publisherStateUpdate) callback. Please handle them according to the following error codes.

Handling non-zero error codes in Stream publishing callback:

1. When "state" is "NO_PUBLISH" and "errorCode" is not 0, it indicates Stream publishing failed and will not retry Stream publishing. At this point, a Stream publishing failure notification can be displayed in the interface.
2. When "state" is "PUBLISH_REQUESTING" and "errorCode" is not 0, it indicates retrying Stream publishing. If Stream publishing is not successful after exceeding the retry time, a Stream publishing failure notification will be thrown.
