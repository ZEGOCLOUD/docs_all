<Warning title="Note">

Only web servers with SSL (HTTPS) are supported. The web service domain name of local debugging tools can use localhost or 127.0.0.1.

</Warning>

## Prerequisites

You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im/), applied for a valid `AppID`, and obtained the `Server URL` for accessing the server. For details, please refer to "Project Information" in [Console - Project Management](/console/project-info).

<Warning title="Note">
- If using SDK version 3.7.0 or above, the `server` parameter can be filled with the `Server URL` obtained from the console or directly filled with an empty string.
- The Server URL is not the ServerSecret. You can refer to the following image to obtain the `Server URL` in the ZEGOCLOUD Console.

```

## Run Example Source Code

1. In the downloaded example source code, use a supported browser to open the "./src/Examples/DebugAndConfig/InitSettings/index.html" file, enter the AppID and Server URL obtained in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) (not ServerSecret), and click "Settings".

2. After the settings are completed, you can start experiencing Demo features. You can use a supported browser to open the HTML files of various scenario features under the "./src/Examples" folder. For example, open "index.html" under the "QuickStart/CommonUsage" folder.

<Warning title="Note">


    - If the local path where the page is stored contains Chinese characters, some browsers may fail to load CSS and other style files when opening the page, and the page will display abnormally. It is recommended that developers set all path names of source code files to "English characters".
    - To facilitate developer debugging, the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im/) provides the function of generating **temporary Tokens**. Developers can directly obtain temporary Tokens for use. For details, please refer to [Console - Development Assistance](/console/development-assistance/temporary-token). However, in the developer's own online environment, Tokens must be generated through their own server.

## Experience Video Call Features

Run the project on a real device. After running successfully, you can see the local video.

For convenience of experience, ZEGO provides a [Web Debugging Example](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html). On this page, enter the same AppID and RoomID, enter different UserIDs, and the corresponding [Token](/console/development-assistance/temporary-token), you can join the same Room to communicate with real device. When the Video Call starts successfully, you can hear the remote audio and see the remote video.
