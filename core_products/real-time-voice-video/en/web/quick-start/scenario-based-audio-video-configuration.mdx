# Scenario-based Audio and Video Configuration

- - -

## Overview

To facilitate quick integration and lower the barrier to entry for developers, the SDK has validated through extensive online data and沉淀出多种场景化配置方案. Developers can choose the corresponding Room scenario based on their needs, and the SDK will automatically apply audio/video codecs, parameters, flow control strategies, and other configurations suitable for that scenario, thereby quickly achieving optimal results for that scenario. Currently supported scenarios include show live streaming, KTV, standard 1v1 Video Call, high-quality 1v1 Video Call, standard voice chat room, and high-quality voice chat room.

## How to Use

Create and initialize an instance of [ZegoExpressEngine](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~class~ZegoExpressEngine). In the [ZegoOptions](@-ZegoOptions) parameter, the `scenario` field needs to specify a scenario ([ZegoScenario](@-ZegoScenario)), which you can choose based on your actual Video Call business scenario.

```js
const zg = new ZegoExpressEngine(appid, server, { scenario: 4 })
```

<Warning title="Note">

- It is recommended that users in the same Room use the same Room scenario to achieve the best results.
- If you need to have multiple Video Call business scenarios, for example, both 1v1 Video Call and show live streaming scenarios. You can switch scenarios by calling the [setRoomScenario](@setRoomScenario) interface after leaving the Room, without creating a new engine instance, and then log in to other Rooms.

</Warning>



Currently the SDK supports the following scenarios:

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col width="20%"/>
    <col width="10%"/>
    <col width="40%"/>
    <col width="30%"/>
  </colgroup>

If after specifying a scenario, developers have needs for fine-grained control over SDK audio/video configurations, they can configure through other APIs with priority higher than scenario-based configurations.

<Accordion title="API interfaces available for fine-grained configuration" defaultOpen="false">
- Video-related configurations
  - [enableVideoCaptureDevice](@enableVideoCaptureDevice)
  - [setVideoConfig](@setVideoConfig)
  - [enableHardwareEncoder](@enableHardwareEncoder)

- Audio-related configurations
  - [setAudioConfig](@setAudioConfig)
</Accordion>

<Warning title="Note">


- After [setRoomScenario](@setRoomScenario) successfully modifies the scenario, it will not affect streams already created by [createZegoStream](@createZegoStream) before the scenario modification, only affecting streams created through [createZegoStream](@createZegoStream) after the scenario modification.
- After leaving the Room, once the scenario is switched through [setRoomScenario](@setRoomScenario), all previous fine-grained audio/video configurations made through the above APIs will be reset to the default values of the new scenario. Therefore, it is recommended to set the scenario first, then adjust audio/video configurations through other APIs.
- If scenario-based configuration is done first, followed by fine-grained audio/video configuration through [createZegoStream](@createZegoStream), the new parameter configuration will override the audio/video related configurations in the scenario settings.
- If you have other scenario setting requirements or configuration questions, please contact ZEGO technical support.
