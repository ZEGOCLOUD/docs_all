# Push Whiteboard to Third-party Platforms

- - -

## Feature Overview

<Warning title="Notice">
This feature requires additional payment. Please contact ZEGOCLOUD sales for pricing information.
</Warning>



This article mainly describes how to use the stream mixing feature of ZEGO Express SDK to merge audio and video streams with [ZegoSuperBoard](/super-board-ios/product-desc/overview) content into a single stream and output it to third-party platforms, such as WeChat, Video Account, etc., to achieve better dissemination and marketing effects.

Whiteboard is a frequently used feature in education, training, and entertainment scenarios. ZegoSuperBoard can be used in combination with Express SDK to provide complete multi-user real-time whiteboard interactive collaboration services, including whiteboard graffiti, real-time trajectory synchronization, synchronization between whiteboard and real-time audio and video, and more.

Many events hope to display the presenter's video, voice, and whiteboard content on third-party platforms, such as WeChat, Video Account, TikTok, etc., to expand dissemination. However, this requires both the presenter and viewer to integrate ZEGO Express and ZegoSuperBoard to implement real-time whiteboard interactive collaboration services, which is complex to implement.

Currently, ZEGO uses the stream mixing feature to combine the presenter's audio and video streams with whiteboard-related operations on the ZEGO server, and then output to third-party platforms. This enables third-party platforms to receive the presenter's video, voice, and whiteboard content simultaneously without integrating ZEGO Express and ZegoSuperBoard.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the whiteboard stream mixing feature, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and Server address. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio and video stream publishing and playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/implementing-video-call).

- You have integrated ZegoSuperBoard SDK in your project and implemented whiteboard-related functions. For details, please refer to [Create Super Whiteboard](/super-board-web/quick-start/create-white-board).

<Warning title="Notice">
The stream mixing feature is not enabled by default. Before using it, please enable it in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) (for enabling steps, please refer to "Stream Mixing" in [Project Management - Service Configuration](/console/service-configuration/enable-stream-mixing-service)), or contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to enable it.
</Warning>




## Implementation Flow

### 1 Initialize and Login to Room

For specific steps, please refer to the [Initialization](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/implementing-video-call) and [Login to Room](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/implementing-video-call) sections of the "Implementing Video Call" document to complete initialization and login to room.

### 2 Set Up Stream Mixing Configuration

In Express SDK, by defining a stream mixing task configuration object that includes input stream layout, output stream, and ZEGO super whiteboard configuration information.

#### Set Up Stream Mixing Input Streams

For specific steps, please refer to [Set Up Stream Mixing Input Streams](/real-time-video-web/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.

#### Set Up Stream Mixing Output

For specific steps, please refer to [Set Up Stream Mixing Output](/real-time-video-web/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.

<Note title="Note">
The address of the third-party platform live room can be configured by setting parameters in the stream mixing output. The live room address format is generally: `rtmp://xxxx`.
</Note>




#### Set Up Stream Mixing Whiteboard Configuration

In the start stream mixing interface, fill in the ZEGO super whiteboard content: you need to fill in parameters such as `whiteboardID` (whiteboard ID), which is the ID and other information returned when integrating ZegoSuperBoard SDK and creating a whiteboard in the [Prerequisites](/real-time-video-web/other/push-the-whiteboard) of this article.

<Note title="Note">

The file formats supported by whiteboard stream mixing are as follows:
- Static presentation files: PPTX, PPT.
- Dynamic presentation files: PPTX, PPT.
- Spreadsheet files: XLS, XLSX.
- Text files: DOC, DOCX, TXT, PDF.
- Image files: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP.


</Note>




### 3 Start Stream Mixing Task

For specific steps, please refer to the [Start Stream Mixing](/real-time-video-web/live-streaming/stream-mixing) section of the stream mixing document.

Taking the whiteboard layout placed in the bottom right corner as an example:

```javascript
const taskID = "task-" + new Date().getTime();
const mixStreamID = "mixwebrtc-" + new Date().getTime();
const publishStreamId = "webrtc-" + new Date().getTime();

try {
  const res = await zg.startMixerTask({
    taskID,
    inputList: [
      {
        streamID: publishStreamId,
        layout: { top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 100, right: 100, layer: 1 }
      }
    ],
    outputList: [mixStreamID],
    outputConfig: {
      outputBitrate: 300,
      outputFPS: 15,
      outputWidth: 200,
      outputHeight: 200
    },
    whiteboard: {
      // ZEGO super whiteboard ID, which is the ID returned when integrating ZegoSuperBoard SDK and creating a whiteboard in the prerequisites of this article
      whiteboardID: "1860061860",
      layout: {
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        bottom: 100,
        right: 100
      },
      horizontalRatio: 16,
      verticalRatio: 9,
      isPPTAnimation: false,
      zOrder: 0,
      backgroundColor: 0x87cefa00
    }
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("startMixerTask", error);
}
```

### 4 Update Stream Mixing Task Configuration

Express SDK supports updating the whiteboard configuration in stream mixing tasks. For example, when you need to switch to a different ZEGO super whiteboard instance or stop mixing the ZEGO super whiteboard, you can update the configuration by calling the [startMixerTask](@startMixerTask) interface. For updating other configurations of the stream mixing task, please refer to [4 Update Stream Mixing Task Configuration](/real-time-video-web/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.


### 5 Stop Stream Mixing

For specific steps, please refer to [Stop Stream Mixing](/real-time-video-web/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.


## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why is there no whiteboard image in the stream mixing result even though I specified to mix the ZEGO super whiteboard in the stream mixing task?" defaultOpen="false">
  Please confirm whether the value of the `whiteboardID` member in the stream mixing task whiteboard configuration is the ID of the ZEGO super whiteboard you want to mix.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is there no corresponding animation effect in the whiteboard image in the stream mixing result even though a PPT file with animation effects is loaded in the ZEGO super whiteboard?" defaultOpen="false">
  Please confirm whether the value of the `isPPTAnimation` member in the stream mixing task whiteboard configuration is true.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I not display the presenter's camera image?" defaultOpen="false">
Yes, but at least one audio stream is required. Otherwise, the whiteboard stream mixing cannot be initiated.
