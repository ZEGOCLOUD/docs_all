# Player Introduction

- - -

## Overview

ZEGO provides a self-developed Web player plugin that can be quickly integrated into Web applications combined with CDN live streaming services, providing developers with monitorable, stable, and smooth CDN live streaming playback capabilities.

<Note title="Note">


The player plugin is mainly suitable for CDN live streaming playback and does not currently support on-demand playback capabilities.

</Note>



## Product Advantages

#### Support H.265 CDN Live Stream Playing

For CDN live streams in H.265 encoding format, the ZEGO player plugin can decode and play normally without encoding degradation.

H.265 is an efficient video encoding standard that can transmit higher quality network video with lower Stream Playing bandwidth.

#### Support Playback Quality Monitoring and Quick Problem Location

- Provides log reporting for quick location and troubleshooting of abnormal issues.
- Supports key quality reporting such as first frame duration, helping developers achieve playback quality monitoring.

#### Low Barrier Convenient Access

Supports low-barrier access and quick integration, and provides comprehensive example source code and experience demos, significantly reducing development costs.

#### Flexible Combination with Other Live Streaming Capabilities

- The player plugin completes CDN Stream Playing capabilities. When used with Express SDK, it supports multiple Stream Playing methods such as RTC, L3 (Ultra-low latency live streaming), and CDN.
- Can support capabilities such as live streaming co-hosting, low-latency high-quality viewing, and large-scale concurrent viewing, providing developers with the best live streaming experience and a full-scenario solution.

<Note title="Note">


- The player plugin has autoplay enabled by default, but browser policy restrictions will affect the autoplay function. We provide an autoplay failure callback. You can use this callback to guide users to click to trigger video playback.

- When the player decodes and plays, by default it decodes with the priority of "WebCodecs hardware decoding > MSE hardware decoding > software decoding". If you need to specify using a certain decoding method, you can manually modify the value of the player plugin's initialization configuration [ZegoExpressPlayerConfig.decodeType](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~ZegoExpressPlayerConfig#decode-type). If the browser does not support the current decoding method, it will automatically fall back to the next method according to priority.
