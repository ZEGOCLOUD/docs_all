## Version 1.5.0 <a id="1.5.0"></a>

**Release Date: 2025-07-23**

**New Features**

1. Support for getting real-time sound waves of audio played by the player.

    Related API please refer to: [enableSoundLevelMonitor](@enableSoundLevelMonitor)

---

## Version 1.3.1 <a id="1.3.1"></a>

**Release Date: 2024-09-24**

**New Features**

1. Added received bytes-related fields to player stream quality data for traffic statistics

    The player stream quality data [QualityStats](@-QualityStats) obtained through [getPlayQuality](@getPlayQuality) and [onResetPlayQuality](@onResetPlayQuality) adds received bytes-related fields, including total received bytes, video data bytes, audio data bytes, and SEI data bytes.

    Related API please refer to: [totalRecvBytes](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~QualityStats#total-recv-bytes), [videoRecvBytes](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~QualityStats#video-recv-bytes), [audioRecvBytes](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~QualityStats#audio-recv-bytes), [seiRecvBytes](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~QualityStats#sei-recv-bytes)


2. Added [onResetPlayQuality](@onResetPlayQuality) callback interface

    When the player resets stream quality data, the [onResetPlayQuality](@onResetPlayQuality) callback will be triggered and return the final stream quality data before the reset. This avoids the inability to obtain the final stream quality data with [getPlayQuality](@getPlayQuality).

    Related API please refer to: [onResetPlayQuality](@onResetPlayQuality)

3. Added [onRecvSEI](@onRecvSEI) callback interface

    When the player receives SEI data, this callback will be triggered.

    Related API please refer to: [onRecvSEI](@onRecvSEI)

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed the issue where [onplay](@onplay) callback was sometimes not triggered when calling the [play](@play) method after calling the [stop](@stop) method and setting the URL address of the CDN live stream to be played through [src](@src).
2. Fixed the issue where [played](@played) and [QualityStats](@-QualityStats) states were incorrect after calling the [stop](@stop) method.
3. Fixed the wasm.gz file decompression anomaly issue.
4. Fixed the issue where switching decoder abnormally failed after WebCodecs decoding failed.
5. Fixed the inaccurate download bitrate and decoding bitrate in [QualityStats](@-QualityStats).

## Version 1.3.0 <a id="1.3.0"></a>

**Release Date: 2024-03-21**

**New Features**

1. Support for getting stream playing quality

    Added the interface for getting stream playing quality [getPlayQuality](@getPlayQuality-ZegoExpressPlayer), facilitating developers to perform related business processing after receiving the stream playing quality callback.

2. Support for setting buffer Buffer

    When using the player plugin to play streams, it supports setting buffer Buffer to improve audio and video playback stability during network jitter.

    Related API please refer to [setBufferInterval](@setBufferInterval-ZegoExpressPlayer)

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed the issue where the player plugin froze due to memory overflow when using soft decoding for a long time.

---

## Version 1.2.0 <a id="1.2.0"></a>

**Release Date: 2024-03-07**

**New Features**

1. Support H.264 and H.265 MSE decoding

    Note:

    - MSE (Media Source Extensions) decoding does not support iOS mobile devices. When using on iOS mobile devices, it will automatically fall back to soft decoding for playback by default.
    - Some devices or browsers do not support H.265 MSE decoding and will automatically fall back to soft decoding for playback.

    The player plugin initialization configuration [ZegoExpressPlayerConfig.decodeType](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~ZegoExpressPlayerConfig#decode-type) parameter adds a new value "MSE", used to specify priority use of MSE decoding to play media resources.

    When the player decodes, it decodes and plays in the priority order of "WebCodecs hardware decoding > MSE hardware decoding > soft decoding". If the browser does not support a certain decoding method, it will automatically fall back to the next method.

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed the issue where there was no audio when rendering audio on some iOS devices due to the device's mute button affecting it.

## Version 1.1.0 <a id="1.1.0"></a>

**Release Date: 2023-12-27**

**New Features**

1. Support H.264 and H.265 WebCodecs hardware decoding

    Note: This function supports use on Chrome browsers on PC and a few Android models. For some Chrome browsers that do not support H.265 WebCodecs hardware decoding, it will automatically fall back to soft decoding.

    If you integrate the player plugin in the Chrome browser on PC, it will prioritize using WebCodecs hardware decoding for playback by default. If you need to specify soft decoding, please manually modify the player plugin initialization configuration [ZegoExpressPlayerConfig.decodeType](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_web~interface~ZegoExpressPlayerConfig#decode-type).

**Improvements and Optimizations**

1. Optimized first frame time and frame drop strategy, resulting in lower average latency compared to previous versions.

2. Reduced the size of the compressed plugin package by 226 KB compared to previous versions.

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed the issue where audio automatically played occasionally when the Web page was in the hidden state.
