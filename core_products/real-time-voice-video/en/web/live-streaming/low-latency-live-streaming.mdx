# Ultra-low Latency Live Streaming

---

## Overview

ZEGO [Ultra-low latency live streaming](/live-streaming-ios/introduction/overview) (Low-Latency Live Streaming, L3) is created for high-quality experience. It can create the ultimate live streaming experience with ultra-low latency, ultra-strong synchronization, extreme weak network resistance, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and first-frame instant start. It is the "hexagon warrior" among live streaming distribution products.

Compared with traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO Ultra-low latency live streaming is based on full-link self-developed private protocols, Massive Sequential Data Network (MSDN), and end-to-end monitoring, providing more stable and higher quality live streaming distribution services, helping the business side solve "live streaming experience" pain points, and is the common choice of many leading live streaming customers.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing ultra-low latency live streaming functionality, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and Server address. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio/video Stream Publishing and Playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Usage Steps

Set the "resourceMode" parameter of [ZegoWebPlayOption](@-ZegoWebPlayOption) to "2", then call the [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStream) interface to pull the remote ultra-low latency live streaming stream based on the passed stream ID parameter "streamID".

```javascript
const playOption = {resourceMode: 2};
const remoteStream = await zg.startPlayingStream(streamID, playOption)
```
