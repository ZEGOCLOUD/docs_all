# Geofencing

- - -

## Feature Introduction


Geofencing refers to limiting audio, video, and signaling data transmission to a specific region to comply with regional data privacy and security regulations, which is to limit access to Video Call services in a specific region. For example, when the specified geofencing region is Europe, regardless of where the App users are located, the region actually accessed by the SDK will be Europe.

<Warning title="Note">

- If all servers in the specified geofencing region are unavailable, the SDK will report an error directly.
- Due to the cross-region public internet between the specified geofencing region and the App user region, poor public internet network quality will affect the Video Call experience.
</Warning>

The current SDK supports the following region configurations:

<Note title="Note">If you need to support more regions, please contact ZEGO technical support.</Note>


|Region|Enum| Value |
|-|-|-|
|China Mainland, excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan|CN| 2 |
|North America|NA| 3 |
|Europe|EU| 4 |
|Asia, excluding China Mainland and India|AS| 5 |
|India|IN| 6 |

## Prerequisites

Before using the geofencing feature, please ensure:
- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im), applied for a valid AppID and Server URL. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic Video Call stream publishing and playing features. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Flow](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/implementing-video-call).

## Implementation Flow

### Enable Geofencing Permission

Geofencing capabilities require fees in some cases. Please contact ZEGO sales to confirm and enable geofencing permissions.


### Set Geofencing

- Geofencing information: includes geofencing type and geofencing region list.
- Geofencing type: includes two types, Include and Exclude. The geofencing type will act on the geofencing region list.
    - Include: indicates that all regions in the region list are included within the geofencing.
    - Exclude: indicates that all regions in the region list are excluded from the geofencing.

Before creating the SDK, call the [setGeoFence](@setGeoFence) interface to set geofencing information.

<Warning title="Note">


Please configure geofencing information before creating the [ZegoExpressEngine](@-ZegoExpressEngine) engine instance, otherwise it will be invalid.

</Warning>




```java
// Example of setting Include mode
const geofenceType = 1;// Set Include mode
const geofenceAreaList = [2,4]; // Set region list information, at least 1 must be set, maximum cannot exceed the number supported by the SDK
ZegoExpressEngine.setGeoFence(geofenceType, geofenceAreaList);// This interface is a static method, called before new ZegoExpressEngine

// Example of setting Exclude mode
const geofenceType = 2;// Set Exclude mode
const geofenceAreaList = [2,4];// Set region list information, at least 1 must be set, maximum cannot be greater than or equal to the number supported by the SDK
ZegoExpressEngine.setGeoFence(geofenceType, geofenceAreaList);// This interface is a static method, called before new ZegoExpressEngine
```

### Integrate Other Features

After completing the geofencing settings, you can proceed with other feature integration.
