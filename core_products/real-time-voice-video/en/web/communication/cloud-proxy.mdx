# Cloud Proxy

- - -

## Overview

By setting the SDK's Cloud Proxy interface, all traffic corresponding to the SDK is forwarded through cloud proxy servers, enabling communication with RTC and L3 ([Ultra-low latency live streaming](/real-time-video-web/live-streaming/low-latency-live-streaming)).

<Warning title="Note">


- The "Cloud Proxy" feature is a `paid` feature. If you need to use this feature, please contact ZEGO business personnel for consultation.
- After enabling the Cloud Proxy service, if the enterprise has configured a firewall, you also need to add the IP, domain name, and port used by the Cloud Proxy to the enterprise firewall whitelist.

</Warning>

Currently, ZEGO Express Web SDK supports `standard Cloud Proxy` mode.

## Prerequisites

Before using Cloud Proxy, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and Server address. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio/video Stream Publishing and Playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-web/quick-start/implementing-video-call).

## Usage Flow

### 1 Enable Cloud Proxy Service

Apply to ZEGO technical support to enable the Cloud Proxy service. After enabling the service, developers will receive a Cloud Proxy domain and port information.

### 2 Configure Cloud Proxy

Call [setCloudProxyConfig](@setCloudProxyConfig) to configure Cloud Proxy.

<Warning title="Note">


This interface must be called as a class static method before creating the [ZegoExpressEngine](@-ZegoExpressEngine) engine instance.

</Warning>



- Interface prototype

```ts
/**
 * Set Cloud Proxy.
 *
 * This interface must be called before initializing the ZegoExpressEngine instance.
 * After calling this interface, all network requests and sending from the Express SDK will be forwarded through the Cloud Proxy.
 *
 * @param proxyList Cloud Proxy information list, supports setting multiple Cloud Proxy information.
 * @param token Authentication token.
 * @param enable Whether to enable Cloud Proxy.
 */
 static setCloudProxyConfig(proxyList: ZegoProxyInfo[], token: string, enable: boolean): void;
```

- Call example

```ts
//Domain and port, developers fill in based on what they obtained when enabling the Cloud Proxy service
const proxyList = [
    {
        hostName: "xxx.xxx1.com",
        port: 443
    },
    {
        hostName: "xxx.xxx2.com",
        port: 443
    }
];
ZegoExpressEngine.setCloudProxyConfig(proxyList, "token", true);
```

## FAQ

<Accordion title="How to solve if Cloud Proxy settings don't take effect?" defaultOpen="false">
- Ensure that the Cloud Proxy service has been enabled and valid proxy ports and domain names have been obtained.
- Ensure that Cloud Proxy is correctly set before creating the [ZegoExpressEngine](@-ZegoExpressEngine) engine instance. Modification during the process is not supported.
