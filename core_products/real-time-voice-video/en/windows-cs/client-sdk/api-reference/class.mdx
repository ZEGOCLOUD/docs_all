| config | [ZegoRoomConfig](./struct#zegoroomconfig) | Advanced room configuration. |

**Details**

If the room does not exist, [loginRoom] creates and logs in the room. SDK uses the 'room' to organize users. After users log in to a room, they can use interface such as push stream [startPublishingStream], pull stream [startPlayingStream], send and receive broadcast messages [sendBroadcastMessage], etc. To prevent the app from being impersonated by a malicious user, you can add authentication before logging in to the room, that is, the [token] parameter in the ZegoRoomConfig object passed in by the [config] parameter.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: In the same room, users can conduct live broadcast, audio and video calls, etc.
- **When to call /Trigger**: This interface is called after [createEngine] initializes the SDK.
- **Caution**:   1. Apps that use different appIDs cannot intercommunication with each other.
  2. SDK supports startPlayingStream audio and video streams from different rooms under the same appID, that is, startPlayingStream audio and video streams across rooms. Since ZegoExpressEngine's room related callback notifications are based on the same room, when developers want to startPlayingStream streams across rooms, developers need to maintain related messages and signaling notifications by themselves.
  3. It is strongly recommended that userID corresponds to the user ID of the business APP, that is, a userID and a real user are fixed and unique, and should not be passed to the SDK in a random userID. Because the unique and fixed userID allows ZEGO technicians to quickly locate online problems.
  4. After the first login failure due to network reasons or the room is disconnected, the default time of SDK reconnection is 20min.
- **Privacy reminder**: Please do not fill in sensitive user information in this interface, including but not limited to mobile phone number, ID number, passport number, real name, etc.
- **Related callbacks**:   1. When the user starts to log in to the room, the room is successfully logged in, or the room fails to log in, the [onRoomStateChanged] (Not supported before 2.18.0, please use [onRoomStateUpdate]) callback will be triggered to notify the developer of the status of the current user connected to the room.
  2. Different users who log in to the same room can get room related notifications in the same room (eg [onRoomUserUpdate], [onRoomStreamUpdate], etc.), and users in one room cannot receive room signaling notifications in another room.
  3. If the network is temporarily interrupted due to network quality reasons, the SDK will automatically reconnect internally. You can get the current connection status of the local room by listening to the [onRoomStateChanged] (Not supported before 2.18.0, please use [onRoomStateUpdate]) callback method, and other users in the same room will receive [onRoomUserUpdate] callback notification.
  4. Messages sent in one room (e.g. [setStreamExtraInfo], [sendBroadcastMessage], [sendBarrageMessage], [sendCustomCommand], etc.) cannot be received callback ((eg [onRoomStreamExtraInfoUpdate], [onIMRecvBroadcastMessage], [onIMRecvBarrageMessage], [onIMRecvCustomCommand], etc) in other rooms. Currently, SDK does not provide the ability to send messages across rooms. Developers can integrate the SDK of third-party IM to achieve.
- **Related APIs**:   1. Users can call [logoutRoom] to log out. In the case that a user has successfully logged in and has not logged out, if the login interface is called again, the console will report an error and print the error code 1002001.
  2. SDK supports multi-room login, please call [setRoomMode] function to select multi-room mode before engine initialization, and then call [loginRoom] to log in to multi-room.
  3. Calling [destroyEngine] will also automatically log out.

When the two functions [muteAllPlayStreamAudio] and [mutePlayStreamAudio] are set to `false` at the same time, the local user can receive the audio data of the remote user when the stream is pulled: 1. When the [muteAllPlayStreamAudio(true)] function is called, it is globally effective, that is, local users will be prohibited from receiving all remote users' audio data. At this time, the [mutePlayStreamAudio] function will not take effect whether it is called before or after [muteAllPlayStreamAudio].2. When the [muteAllPlayStreamAudio(false)] function is called, the local user can receive the audio data of all remote users. At this time, the [mutePlayStreamAudio] function can be used to control whether to receive a single audio data. Calling the [mutePlayStreamAudio(true, streamID)] function allows the local user to receive audio data other than the `streamID`; calling the [mutePlayStreamAudio(false, streamID)] function allows the local user to receive all audio data.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| streamID | string | Stream ID. |
| mute | bool | Whether it is possible to receive the video data of the specified remote user when streaming, "true" means prohibition, "false" means receiving, the default value is "false". The default value for automatically played streams within the SDK is false. |

**Details**

In the process of real-time video and video interaction, local users can use this function to control whether to receive video data from designated remote users when pulling streams as needed. When the developer does not receive the video data, the hardware and network overhead can be reduced.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: This function can be called when developers need to quickly close and resume watching remote video. Compared to re-flow, it can greatly reduce the time and improve the interactive experience.
- **When to call**: This function can be called after calling [createEngine].
- **Caution**: 
 1. When used together with [muteAllPlayVideoStreams], they can override each other's configurations. 
 2. When used together with [muteAllPlayStreamAudio], this function only works when the [muteAllPlayStreamVideo] function is set to `false`. 
 3. When you mute the video stream, the view remains at the last frame by default, if you need to clear the last frame, please contact ZEGO technical support. 
 4. After stopping streaming, any properties previously set for this stream such as [setPlayVolume], [mutePlayStreamAudio], [mutePlayStreamVideo] and other streaming-related configurations will become invalid and need to be reset before the next stream is pulled.
- **Related APIs**: You can call the [muteAllPlayStreamVideo] function to control whether to receive all video data. When the two functions [muteAllPlayStreamVideo] and [mutePlayStreamVideo] are set to `false` at the same time, the local user can receive the video data of the remote user when the stream is pulled: 1. When the [muteAllPlayStreamVideo(true)] function is called, it will take effect globally, that is, local users will be prohibited from receiving all remote users' video data. At this time, the [mutePlayStreamVideo] function will not take effect whether it is called before or after [muteAllPlayStreamVideo]. 2. When the [muteAllPlayStreamVideo(false)] function is called, the local user can receive the video data of all remote users. At this time, the [mutePlayStreamVideo] function can be used to control whether to receive a single video data. Call the [mutePlayStreamVideo(true, streamID)] function, the local user can receive other video data other than the `streamID`; call the [mutePlayStreamVideo(false, streamID)] function, the local user can receive all the video data.

**Details**

Initiate a mixing stream request to the ZEGO RTC server, the server will look for the stream currently being pushed, and mix the layers according to the parameters of the mixing stream task requested by the SDK. When you need to update a mixing task, that is, when the input stream increases or decreases, you need to update the input stream list. At this time, you can update the field of the [ZegoMixerTask] object inputList and call this function again to pass in the same [ZegoMixerTask] object to update the mixing task.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: It is often used when multiple video images are required to synthesize a video using mixed streaming, such as education, live broadcast of teacher and student images.
- **When to call**: After calling [loginRoom] to log in to the room.
- **Caution**: Due to the performance considerations of the client device, the SDK muxing is to start the mixing task on the ZEGO RTC server for mixing. If an exception occurs when the mixing task is requested to start, for example, the most common mixing input stream does not exist, the error code will be given from the callback callback. If a certain input stream does not exist in the middle, the muxing task will automatically retry to pull this input stream for 90 seconds, and will not retry after 90 seconds. If all input streams no longer exist, the server will automatically stop the mixing task after 90 seconds.
- **Related callbacks**: [OnMixerRelayCDNStateUpdate] can be used to obtain the CDN status update notification of the mixed stream repost, and the sound update notification of each single stream in the mixed stream can be obtained through [onMixerSoundLevelUpdate].
- **Related APIs**: the mixing task can be stopped by the [stopMixerTask] function.

**Details**

When developers do not have much need for beauty features, they can use this function to set some very simple beauty effects.

<Note title="">
- **When to call**: It needs to be called after [createEngine].
- **Default value**: When this function is not called, the beauty feature is not enabled by default.
- **Related APIs**: After turning on the beauty features, you can call the [setBeautifyOption] function to adjust the beauty parameters.
- **Caution**: This beauty feature is very simple and may not meet the developer’s expectations. It is recommended to use the custom video processing function [enableCustomVideoProcessing] or the custom video capture function [enableCustomVideoCapture] to connect the AI Effects SDK [ZegoEffects] [https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/9896](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/9896) for best results.
</Note>

<Warning title="">
- **Available since**: 1.1.0
- **Restrictions**: In the case of using the custom video capture function, since the developer has handle the video data capturing, the SDK is no longer responsible for the video data capturing, so this function is no longer valid.
