| Common Video Configuration | During video calls or live streaming, customize the video settings for capture and playback, such as video capture resolution, video encoding output resolution, frame rate, bitrate, view mode, and mirror mode. | Special requirements for resolution, bitrate, mirroring, etc. |
| Pre-call Detection  | Before conducting audio and video calls or live streaming, perform device detection on cameras, microphones, monitors, etc., to ensure the normal operation of calls or live streaming.  | Normal call function detection  |
| Audio and Video Quality Detection | Detect the quality of audio and video, such as multi-metric detection of resolution, frame rate, bitrate, sampling rate, etc., to ensure quality stability. | Bank account opening, remote authentication, and other scenarios with high requirements and restrictions on audio and video quality    |
| Stream Mixing    | Mix multiple video streams from multiple users into one stream, so that you only need to play one stream to see the video of all members in the room and hear the audio of all members in the room. | Multi-person call with host mic connection  |
| CDN Live Streaming | Unified access to multiple CDN capabilities. This feature supports pushing streams to CDN, connecting RTC products and CDN live streaming products, making it convenient for users to watch live content directly from web pages or third-party players.  | Basic live streaming with high concurrency, scenarios without strong requirements for live streaming latency  |
| Media Player   | Provides the ability to play audio and video media files, and supports pushing the audio and video data of played media files out as a stream. | <ul><li>Play test audio</li> <li>Play background music</li> <li>Play video files</li></ul>  |
| Watermark     | Can add watermarks such as copyright logos to the video image.| Video sharing with copyright, etc. |
| Room Real-time Messaging | Real-time messaging mainly provides the function of sending and receiving pure text messages. You can send broadcast messages and barrage messages to other users in the same room, or send custom messages to specified users, and implement interactive functions such as likes, gifts, and quizzes as needed. | <ul><li>Showcase live streaming</li> <li>Live audio room</li></ul> |
| User Permission Control | Control user permissions, such as: specified users can join/leave rooms; specified users can speak/mute; specified users. | Video conference  |




## Advanced Features

|------|------|------|
| [Live Mic Connection](/real-time-video-windows-cs/quick-start/implementing-video-call) | In a room, multiple hosts can appear and conduct on-screen mic connection live streaming. | <ul><li>Multi-host mic connection from different regions</li> <li>Multi-person KTV chorus</li><li>Multi-person mic connection live streaming</li></ul>  |
| Login Multiple Rooms | A user can enter multiple rooms at the same time for audio and video calls or watch live streaming. | Teachers teaching multiple classes online  |
| Publish Multiple Streams Simultaneously  | A user can publish multiple audio and video streams, such as sending the camera's video stream while sharing the screen. | View the speaker's image while playing PPT in a video conference |
| Play Stream by URL | When the publishing end uses third-party publishing tools (e.g., OBS software, network camera IP Camera, etc.) to push streams to CDN, or when using the ZEGO SDK to relay streams to CDN to push audio and video content to third-party CDNs, you can use the method of directly passing in the URL address to play streams. | Third-party live stream image retrieval   |
| Audio and Video Recording    | During video calls, live streaming, and online teaching, users often need to record and save videos for subsequent on-demand viewing by other users. ZEGO provides multiple recording solutions to meet recording needs in different scenarios.| <ul><li>Conference recording</li> <li>Live streaming recording</li><li>Call recording</li><li>Online classroom recording</li></ul>  |
| Media Supplemental Enhancement Information  | Text information is packaged with audio and video content and transmitted through the streaming media channel to achieve precise synchronization between text data and audio and video content.  | <ul><li>Precise layout of video images</li> <li>Remote lyric synchronization</li> <li>Live quiz</li></ul> |
| Custom Video Capture | Customize the provision of video input source to ZEGO Express SDK to input video data, and let ZEGO Express SDK perform encoding and stream publishing.  | <ul><li>Using beauty SDK from third-party beauty vendors</li> <li>Camera cannot be used normally by SDK</li> <li>Streaming data not captured by camera</li></ul>    |
| Custom Video Encoding/Decoding  | Detailed settings can be made for video encoding and decoding, including enabling layered video encoding, using hardware encoding and decoding, and setting encoding methods. | When there are special requirements for encoding and decoding |
| Custom Video Rendering   | Custom video rendering refers to the SDK providing video frame data for local preview and remote stream playing to the outside world for users to render themselves.  | <ul><li>App uses cross-platform UI framework or game engine</li> <li>App needs to obtain video frame data captured or played by SDK for special processing</li></ul> |
| Audio Spectrum and Volume Change  | Audio spectrum: the energy value of digital audio signals at each frequency point.<br /> Volume change: the volume of a certain stream. | <ul><li>Determine which user on the mic is speaking, whether the microphone, speaker, etc. are available</li> <li>Audio spectrum animation display, etc.</li></ul>  |
| Headphone Monitor        | Headphone acquisition monitoring. After inserting headphones (ordinary headphones or Bluetooth headphones) into the device, you can hear the sound captured by the device's microphone from the local headphone side. |<ul><li>Showcase live streaming</li> <li>Emotional FM</li> <li>Music teaching and other relatively professional scenarios</li></ul>|
| Sound Effect Player   | Provides a sound effect player and manages sound effects uniformly to achieve effects such as playback control of short sound effects that enhance realism or set the scene atmosphere. | <ul><li>Showcase live streaming</li> <li>Gaming entertainment</li></ul> |
| Original Audio Data Access  | The function of obtaining original audio recording, and the obtained original audio data format is PCM.| Audio data retention or special processing  |
| Custom Audio Capture  | Developers can obtain audio information by themselves and then hand it over to the SDK for transmission. | <ul><li>Online or local audio file transmission</li> <li>Transmission of audio files from custom capture systems</li></ul> |
| Custom Audio Rendering  | Audio is rendered and played by the developer themselves.| Developers have their own special rendering requirements  |


## Special Features

| Special Features-20%    | Feature Description-50%    | Business Scenarios-30%    |

|Subject Segmentation | ZEGO industry-leading technology. At the publishing end, the subject (mostly a person in most cases) in the rectangular video is separated through AI algorithms and transmitted in the RTC network, and rendered at the playing end. | Multi-person on-stage in different locations, showcase live streaming on-stage PK, multi-person online study, and other multi-person on-stage scenarios |
| Audio 3A Processing | During real-time audio and video calls or live streaming, 3A processing can be performed on audio to improve call or live streaming quality and user experience.<ul><li>AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation): Filters captured audio data to reduce echo in audio.</li><li>AGC (Automatic Gain Control): After enabling this feature, the SDK can automatically adjust microphone volume to adapt to near and far sound pickup and maintain stable volume.</li><li>ANS (Noise Suppression): Identifies background noise in sound and eliminates it. After enabling this feature, human voice can be clearer.</li></ul> | All scenarios that hope to have high-quality real-time audio and video services |
| Traffic Control | ZEGO industry-leading technology. The SDK dynamically adjusts video stream publishing bitrate, frame rate, resolution, and audio bitrate based on its own and the peer's current network environment status, automatically adapts to the current network environment and network fluctuations, thereby ensuring smooth video publishing.| All scenarios that hope to have high-quality real-time audio and video services |
