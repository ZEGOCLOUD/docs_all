# Differences Between Video Call SDK and Audio Call SDK

- - -

Starting from version v2.20.0, there are no longer API differences between Video Call and Audio Call, which means you can switch from Video Call SDK to Audio Call SDK at any time, and vice versa.

The only difference between the Audio Call SDK and the Video Call SDK is functional: For the Audio Call SDK, some video-related APIs (such as video encoding parameter settings, ZegoCanvas parameters for preview and stream playing, etc.) have no effect when set, but will not cause errors.

The involved APIs are as follows:

- [startPreview](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/startPreview.html)
    - Effect in Video Call SDK: Starts the microphone and camera, and if a view is passed in the canvas parameter, the SDK will render the preview in that view.
    - Effect in Audio Call SDK: Starts the microphone. Developers can set the canvas parameter to null when calling this API, or if there is an overloaded function, use the overloaded function of this API without the canvas parameter (only for non-web platforms).

<Warning title="Caution">

When calling [startPreview](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/startPreview.html) on the Audio Call Flutter / Electron / uni-app / Unity3D / React-Native SDK, the camera will still be started; developers can call [enableCamera](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngineDevice/enableCamera.html) before calling [startPreview](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/startPreview.html) to disable the camera, to avoid the SDK requesting camera permissions.

</Warning>

- [startPlayingStream](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePlayer/startPlayingStream.html)
    - Effect in Video Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the stream, and if the developer passes a view in the canvas parameter, the SDK will render the video of the stream in that view.
    - Effect in Audio Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the stream. Developers can set the canvas parameter to null when calling this API, or if there is an overloaded function, use the overloaded function of this API without the canvas parameter (only for non-web platforms).

<Warning title="Caution">

All other video-related APIs have no effect in the Audio Call SDK. You can determine whether an API is video-related by the note provided in the API: `Note: This function is only available in ZegoExpressVideo SDK!`. If this note exists, it means the API is video-related.

</Warning>
