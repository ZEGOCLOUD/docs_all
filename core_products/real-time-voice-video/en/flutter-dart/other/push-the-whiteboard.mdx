# Pushing Whiteboard to Third-party Platforms

- - -

## Feature Overview

<Warning title="Note">
This feature requires additional payment. Please contact ZEGO sales personnel for pricing.
</Warning>



This article mainly describes how to use the stream mixing feature of ZEGO Express SDK to merge audio and video streams with [ZegoSuperBoard](/super-board-ios/product-desc/overview) content into one stream and output it to third-party platforms, such as WeChat, Video Account, etc., to achieve better dissemination and marketing effects.

Whiteboard is a high-frequency function used in education, training, and entertainment scenarios. ZegoSuperBoard can be used in combination with Express SDK to provide complete multi-user real-time whiteboard interactive collaboration services, including: whiteboard graffiti, real-time trajectory synchronization, whiteboard and real-time audio and video synchronization, and other capabilities.

Many events hope to broadcast the speaker's video, voice, and whiteboard content on third-party platforms, such as WeChat, Video Account, TikTok, etc., to expand the dissemination effect. However, this requires both the speaker side and the player side to integrate ZEGO Express and ZegoSuperBoard to achieve real-time whiteboard interactive collaboration services, which is complex to implement.

Currently, ZEGO uses the stream mixing feature to synthesize the speaker's audio and video stream with whiteboard-related operations into one stream on the ZEGO server side, and then output it to third-party platforms. This enables third-party platforms to receive the speaker's video, voice, and whiteboard content simultaneously without integrating ZEGO Express and ZegoSuperBoard.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the whiteboard mixing feature, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio and video streaming functionality. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-flutter/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-flutter/quick-start/implementing-video-call).

- You have integrated ZegoSuperBoard SDK in your project to implement whiteboard-related functions.

<Warning title="Note">


The stream mixing feature is not enabled by default. Please enable it yourself in the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) before use (for enabling steps, please refer to "Stream Mixing" in [Project Management - Service Configuration](/console/service-configuration/enable-stream-mixing-service)), or contact ZEGO technical support to enable it.

</Warning>




## Implementation Process

### 1 Initialize and Login to Room

For specific procedures, please refer to the [Initialization](/real-time-video-flutter/quick-start/implementing-video-call) and [Login Room](/real-time-video-flutter/quick-start/implementing-video-call) sections of the "Implementing Video Call" document to complete initialization and login to the room.

### 2 Set Stream Mixing Configuration

In Express SDK, define the stream mixing task configuration object through [ZegoMixerTask](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMixerTask-class.html), which includes information such as input stream layout, output stream, and ZEGO super whiteboard configuration.

**Create Stream Mixing Task Object**

For specific procedures, please refer to [Create Stream Mixing Task Object](/real-time-video-flutter/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.

**Set Stream Mixing Input Stream**

For specific procedures, please refer to [Set Stream Mixing Input Stream](/real-time-video-flutter/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.

**Set Stream Mixing Output**

For specific procedures, please refer to [Set Stream Mixing Output](/real-time-video-flutter/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.

<Note title="Note">

The live room address of third-party platforms can be configured by setting parameters in the stream mixing output. The live room address format is generally: `rtmp://xxxx`.

</Note>




**Set Stream Mixing Whiteboard Configuration**

Call the [ZegoMixerTask > whiteboard](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMixerTask/whiteboard.html) interface to mix ZEGO super whiteboard content into the stream mixing: you need to fill in parameters such as [whiteboardID](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMixerWhiteboard/whiteboardID.html) (whiteboard ID), which is the ID and other information returned when integrating ZegoSuperBoard SDK and creating the whiteboard in the [Prerequisites](/real-time-video-flutter/other/push-the-whiteboard) of this article.

<Note title="Note">

The file formats supported by whiteboard mixing are as follows:
- Static presentation files: PPTX, PPT.
- Dynamic presentation files: PPTX, PPT.
- Spreadsheet files: XLS, XLSX.
- Text files: DOC, DOCX, TXT, PDF.
- Image files: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP.

</Note>



Taking the whiteboard layout placed in the upper left corner of the screen as an example:

```dart
ZegoMixerWhiteboard whiteboard = ZegoMixerWhiteboard.defaultConfig();

// ZEGO super whiteboard ID, which is the ID returned when integrating ZegoSuperBoard SDK and creating the whiteboard in the prerequisites of this article
whiteboard.whiteboardID = 0;

// ZEGO super whiteboard view layout
whiteboard.layout.left = 0;
whiteboard.layout.top = 0;
whiteboard.layout.right = 100;
whiteboard.layout.bottom = 100;

// Whether ZEGO super whiteboard supports loading dynamic PPT
whiteboard.isPPTAnimation = true;

if (whiteboard != null) {
    mMixerTask.whiteboard = whiteboard;
}
```

### 3 Start Stream Mixing Task

For specific procedures, please refer to the [Start Stream Mixing Task](/real-time-video-flutter/live-streaming/stream-mixing) section of the stream mixing document.


### 4 Update Stream Mixing Task Configuration

Express SDK supports updating the whiteboard configuration in the stream mixing task. For example, when you need to switch the ZEGO super whiteboard instance to be mixed or no longer mix ZEGO super whiteboard, you can update the configuration by calling the [startMixerTask](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngineMixer/startMixerTask.html) interface. For updating other configurations of the stream mixing task, please refer to [Update Stream Mixing Task Configuration](/real-time-video-flutter/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.

Taking the example of no longer mixing ZEGO super whiteboard content into the stream mixing:

```dart
// Reset stream mixing task whiteboard configuration information
mMixerTask.whiteboard = ZegoMixerWhiteboard.defaultConfig();

// Call the start stream mixing task interface again to update the stream mixing configuration
engine.startMixerTask(mMixerTask);
```

### 5 Stop Stream Mixing

For specific procedures, please refer to [Stop Stream Mixing](/real-time-video-flutter/live-streaming/stream-mixing) in the stream mixing document.


## FAQ

1. **Why is there no whiteboard video in the stream mixing result even though ZEGO super whiteboard is specified in the stream mixing task?**

  Please confirm whether the value of the `whiteboardID` member in the stream mixing task whiteboard configuration is the ZEGO super whiteboard ID you want to mix into the stream mixing.

2. **Why is there no corresponding animation in the whiteboard video in the stream mixing result even though a PPT file with animation effects is loaded in ZEGO super whiteboard?**

  Please confirm whether the value of the `isPPTAnimation` member in the stream mixing task whiteboard configuration is true.

3. **Can I not display the speaker's camera video?**

Yes, but at least one audio stream is required. Otherwise, whiteboard mixing cannot be initiated.
