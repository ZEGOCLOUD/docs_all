## Overview

ZEGO [Live Streaming](/live-streaming-ios/introduction/overview) (Low-Latency Live Streaming, L3) is built for high-quality experience, creating the ultimate live streaming experience with ultra-low latency, super-strong synchronization, extreme weak network resistance, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and first-frame instant opening. It is the "hexagonal warrior" among live streaming distribution products.

Compared with traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO Live Streaming is based on full-link self-developed private protocols, massive ordered data networks (MSDN), and end-to-end monitoring, providing more stable and higher-quality live streaming distribution services, helping the business side solve "live streaming experience" pain points, and is the common choice of many leading live streaming customers.

<Warning title="Caution">
The low-latency playing stream feature is not enabled by default. Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to activate this feature before using it.

### Feature Highlights

Live Streaming supports tens of millions of ultra-large concurrency, providing stable and high-quality live streaming distribution services with the following 6 major high-quality features:

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Highlights</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-low latency</td>
<td>Live streaming latency of 600 ms to 1000 ms under normal network conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Super-strong synchronization
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level synchronization, synchronization error between different viewers < 400ms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extreme weak network resistance</td>
<td>Supports extreme weak network resistance, up to 80% packet loss without disconnection, and can still play stably in complex network environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-low stuttering</td>
<td>Compared with CDN live streaming, using ZEGO Live Streaming can reduce the stuttering rate by up to 75% or more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-clear picture quality</td>
<td>Through the All-in-one SDK, it provides rich picture quality optimization capabilities to achieve user-level high-quality picture quality practices in various scenarios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First-frame instant opening</td>
<td>Using an exclusive decoupled underlying architecture and providing instant opening strategies such as pre-loading live streams, supports viewers to enter the room at extreme speed, achieving up to 99% domestic instant opening rate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


### Application Scenarios

Live Streaming can be applied to the following scenarios:

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Application Scenario</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Overseas live streaming
</td>
<td>
Breaking through pain points such as high stuttering, slow first frame, and poor picture quality one by one, improving the live streaming experience of global viewers, allowing global users to enjoy live streaming social interaction.
Break through bottlenecks such as poor overseas network environments, high proportion of mid-to-low-end devices, and poor broadcasting environments for amateur anchors, helping enterprises achieve overseas localization.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show live streaming</td>
<td>Provides essential show live streaming features such as instant opening and beauty effects, supporting seamless switching solutions for multiple scenarios such as cross-room PK and live streaming to 1 V 1.
While ensuring the live viewing experience of all viewers, it focuses on guaranteeing the experience quality of big anchors and paid users, effectively promoting the growth of paid users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Education large class
</td>
<td>Ultra-low latency online classroom, perfectly compatible with diverse teaching plugins, providing excellent teacher-student interactive experience, making students' and teachers' classroom progress consistent, and teaching immersion comparable to offline classrooms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gaming live streaming</td>
<td>In high-bitrate gaming scenarios, it can adaptively transcode according to viewer bandwidth, effectively reducing the stuttering rate so that all viewers can watch game interactions smoothly. Based on high-definition low-bitrate, it effectively improves game picture quality at the same bitrate, not limited by viewer-side network bottlenecks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Event live streaming
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level latency and ultra-low stuttering, say goodbye to spoilers, grasp the dynamics of the venue in real time, and never miss any highlight moments. Supports 4K 60fps and HDR, presenting rich venue details and silky ultra-clear dynamic pictures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E-commerce live streaming</td>
<td>Matches the strong real-time requirements of selling goods, anchors respond to viewers' shopping consultations at extreme speed, improving the stickiness between anchors and viewers.
Achieve strong synchronization and fairness for activities such as auctions, snap-ups, and flash sales, stimulating the order conversion of live room users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Watch together</td>
<td>Global massive viewers can synchronously watch movies, concerts, or competitive games in the same live room. The low-latency, multi-terminal synchronized audio-visual experience helps users communicate at zero distance and brings an immersive viewing experience.</td>
</tr>

## Prerequisites

Before implementing live streaming functionality, please ensure:

- You have integrated the ZEGO Express SDK into your project and implemented basic real-time audio and video functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-flutter/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-flutter/quick-start/implementing-video-call).
- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and obtained a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).

## Usage Steps

Set the `resourceMode` parameter of [ZegoPlayerConfig](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoPlayerConfig-class.html) to `ZegoStreamResourceMode.OnlyL3`, and call the [startPlayingStream](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePlayer/startPlayingStream.html) interface to play the ultra-low latency live stream pushed remotely based on the passed stream ID parameter `streamID`.

```dart
var playerConfig = ZegoPlayerConfig.defaultConfig();
playerConfig.resourceMode = ZegoStreamResourceMode.OnlyL3;
// If using Video Call SDK or audio and video scenarios, you need to pass the canvas parameter
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.startPlayingStream(streamID, canvas: playCanvas, config: playerConfig);
// If using Audio Call SDK or audio-only scenarios, you do not need to pass the canvas parameter
// ZegoExpressEngine.instance.startPlayingStream(streamID, config: playerConfig);
```
