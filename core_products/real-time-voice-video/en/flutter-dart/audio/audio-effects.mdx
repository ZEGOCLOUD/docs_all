# Voice Changer/Reverb/Stereo

- - -

## Function Overview

<Warning title="Note">


This document does not apply to the Web platform.

</Warning>



In live streaming, voice chat rooms, and karaoke rooms scenarios, to increase fun and interactivity, players can use voice changing to be funny, use reverb to enhance the atmosphere, and use stereo to make sound more three-dimensional. ZegoExpress SDK provides various preset voice changer, reverb, reverb echo, and stereo effects. Developers can flexibly set the desired sound. If you need to preview, you can enable in-ear monitoring for testing.

* Voice Changer: By changing the user's pitch, the output sound is perceptually different from the original sound, achieving effects such as male voice changing to female voice.
* Reverb: Through special processing of sound, create reverb effects of different environments, making the sound appear as if it were in a concert hall, cathedral, etc.
* Reverb Echo: Through special processing of sound, it can be combined with voice changer and reverb to achieve various customized sound effects, such as ethereal, robotic sounds.
* Virtual Stereo: By deeply using dual-channel technology, virtualize various positions and angles of sound sources, achieving stereo, 3D surround sound, sound positioning, and other effects.

You can experience the SDK's preset voice effects through the [Sound Effects Experience DEMO](https://www.zego.im/audio-demo) provided by ZEGO.

<Note title="Description">


This function only applies to sound captured by the SDK. Developers can dynamically adjust voice changer, reverb, reverb echo, and virtual stereo during calls or live streaming.

```

**Set Custom Voice Changer**

<Note title="Description">



If you need to set preset voice changer, please refer to [Set Preset Voice Changer](/real-time-video-flutter/audio/audio-effects).

</Note>



If the SDK's preset voice changer effects cannot meet your needs, developers can call the [ZegoVoiceChangerParam ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoVoiceChangerParam-class.html) method and set custom voice changer through the pitch parameter "pitch". The value range of this parameter is [-12.0, 12.0]. The larger the value, the sharper the sound. The default value is "0.0" (i.e., no voice changer).

<Warning title="Note">

For versions 2.18.0 and earlier, the value range is [-8.0, 8.0].

</Warning>



```dart
var voiceChangerParam = ZegoVoiceChangerParam(2.0);
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.setVoiceChangerParam(ZegoMediaPlayerAudioChannel.All, param);
```

### Reverb

There are two ways to set reverb: preset reverb and custom reverb.

**Set Preset Reverb**

<Note title="Description">



If you need to set custom reverb, please refer to [Set Custom Reverb](/real-time-video-flutter/audio/audio-effects).

</Note>



Call [setReverbPreset](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/setReverbPreset.html) to set reverb through preset enumeration.

The preset reverb effects of [ZegoReverbPreset](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoReverbPreset.html) are as follows. Developers can choose according to their needs:

| Type Name|Description| Reverb Type|
| ------------ | ------ |----- |
| NONE | None |-|
| SOFT_ROOM | Small room |Space shaping|
| LARGE_ROOM | Large room|Space shaping|
| CONCERT_HALL | Concert hall|Space shaping|
| VALLEY | Valley|Space shaping|
| RECORDING_STUDIO | Recording studio|Space shaping|
| BASEMENT | Basement | Space shaping|
| KTV | KTV, suitable for users with more obvious vocal flaws |Space shaping|
| POPULAR | Popular|Music style|
| ROCK | Rock |Music style|
| VOCAL_CONCERT | Vocal concert|Space shaping|
| GRAMO_PHONE | Gramophone |Space shaping|
| ENHANCED_KTV | Enhanced KTV, more focused and brighter KTV vocal effect, suitable for ordinary users and professional users | Space shaping |


The following example code uses "Large Room" mode as an example:

```dart
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.setReverbPreset(ZegoReverbPreset.LargeRoom);
```

**Set Custom Reverb**

<Note title="Description">



If you need to set preset reverb, please refer to [Set Preset Reverb](/real-time-video-flutter/audio/audio-effects).

</Note>



If the SDK's preset reverb types cannot meet your needs, developers can call the [ZegoReverbAdvancedParam ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoReverbAdvancedParam-class.html) method and set relevant parameters in combination to achieve the reverb effect developers need (for detailed parameter description, please refer to the API documentation).

```dart
var reverbParam = ZegoReverbAdvancedParam(
    50.0, // roomSize Room size (percentage)
    50.0, // reverberance Reverberation (percentage)
    50.0, // damping Reverb damping (percentage)
    false, // wetOnly Wet signal only
    5.0, // wetGain Wet signal gain(dB)
    5.0, // dryGain Dry signal gain(dB)
    80.0, // toneLow Low frequency attenuation
    80.0, // toneHigh High frequency attenuation
    20.0, // preDelay Initial delay time(ms)
    0.0 // stereoWidth Stereo width (percentage)
   );
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.setReverbAdvancedParam(reverbParam);
```

<Warning title="Note">


When custom reverb parameters are set, the preset reverb effect set when enabling reverb will become invalid. If you want to use the SDK preset parameters again, you can use the [setReverbPreset ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/setReverbPreset.html) preset enumeration method to set.

</Warning>




### Reverb Echo

Call the [setReverbEchoParam ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/setReverbEchoParam.html) method and set relevant parameters in combination to achieve the reverb echo effect developers need (for detailed parameter description, please refer to the API documentation).

The following example code takes implementing "ethereal sound effect" as an example:

```dart
var echoParam = ZegoReverbEchoParam(
    0.8, // inGain Input audio signal gain
    1.0, // outGain Output audio signal gain
    7, // numDelays Number of echoes
    [230,460,690,920,1150,1380,1610], // delay Delay of echo signals respectively, in milliseconds
    [0.41f,0.18f,0.08f,0.03f,0.009f,0.003f,0.001f] // decay Decay coefficient of echo signals respectively
    );
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.setReverbEchoParam(echoParam);
```

### Virtual Stereo

**Set Publishing Audio Channel Count**

If you need to enable the virtual stereo function, you must call the [setAudioConfig ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/setAudioConfig.html) method before publishing to set the audio encoding channel to Stereo dual channel (the default is Mono single channel).

This example constructs [ZegoAudioConfig ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioConfig/ZegoAudioConfig.html) through preset enumeration and sets it to dual channel.

```dart
var audioConfig = ZegoAudioConfig.preset(ZegoAudioConfigPreset.StandardQualityStereo);
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.setAudioConfig(audioConfig);
```

**Set Virtual Stereo Parameters**

After setting the audio encoding channel to dual channel, call the [enableVirtualStereo ](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/enableVirtualStereo.html) method and set the virtual stereo source angle through the `enable` parameter to have a stereo effect. The angle range is 0 ~ 360. Generally, it can be set to 90 degrees (i.e., directly in front).

<Note title="Description">



Since version 2.15.0, the SDK has added support for all-around virtual stereo effect. The usage is to set the `angle` parameter to "-1".

</Note>




This example enables virtual stereo and sets the angle to 90 degrees:

```dart
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.enableVirtualStereo(true, 90);
```

This example enables all-around virtual stereo:

```dart
ZegoExpressEngine.instance.enableVirtualStereo(true, -1);
```
