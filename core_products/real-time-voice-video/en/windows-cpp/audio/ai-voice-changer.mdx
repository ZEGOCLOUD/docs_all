# AI Voice Changer

- - -


## Introduction

The "Conan Voice Changer Bow Tie" in real-time calls perfectly reproduces the target character's timbre and rhythm, while preserving the user's speech rate, emotion, and tone. Switch timbres at will, and ultra-low latency allows users to enjoy social voice chat, live streaming, game voice, and other scenarios freely.

<Warning title="Note">
- The "AI Voice Changer" feature is a paid feature. If you need to apply for a trial or inquire about formal pricing, please contact ZEGO business personnel.
- This feature is supported starting from version 3.10.0. The current official website SDK does not include this feature. If needed, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for special packaging.
- Currently, this feature does not support simultaneous use with "Custom Audio Processing".
</Warning>

### Feature Advantages

- Ultra-high sound quality, ultra-low latency.
- Flexible and realistic, perfectly reproducing the target character's timbre and rhythm, while preserving the user's speech rate, emotion, and tone.
- Massive timbres for flexible selection, supporting timbre customization.

### Applicable Scenarios

This feature can be used in the following real-time scenarios to achieve user timbre transformation.

- Social voice chat
- Game voice
- Audio and video live streaming
- Virtual human

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the AI Voice Changer feature, ensure that:

- A project has been created in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com), and valid AppID and AppSign have been obtained. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- ZEGO Express SDK has been integrated into the project, and basic audio and video streaming functionality has been implemented. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Process](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/implementing-video-call).



## Usage Steps

Developers can complete the relevant settings of AI Voice Changer according to the following steps:

### 1 Enable Permission

Please confirm that you have contacted ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for special packaging and enabled the AI Voice Changer permission.

### 2 Initialize and Login Room

For the specific process of initialization and logging in to the room, please refer to "[Create Engine](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/implementing-video-call)" and "[Login Room](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/implementing-video-call)" in the Implementing Video Call document.

### 3 Initialize AI Voice Changer Engine Instance

1. Call the [createAIVoiceChanger](@createAIVoiceChanger) interface to create an AI Voice Changer engine instance.

    Currently, only creating one instance at the same time is supported. Before calling the [destroyAIVoiceChanger](@destroyAIVoiceChanger) interface to destroy the instance, creating again will return NULL.

    ```cpp
    // Create AI Voice Changer engine instance
    aiVoiceChanger = engine.createAIVoiceChanger();
    ```

2. Call the [IZegoAIVoiceChanger.setEventHandler](@setEventHandler-IZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to set AI Voice Changer engine event callbacks.

    ```cpp
    // Set AI Voice Changer engine event callbacks
    aiVoiceChanger->setEventHandler(this);
    ```

3. Call the [IZegoAIVoiceChanger.initEngine](@initEngine-IZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to initialize the AI Voice Changer engine instance.

    <Warning title="Note">
    The [IZegoAIVoiceChanger.initEngine](@initEngine-IZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface must be called before the [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) interface to take effect.
    </Warning>

    ```cpp
    // Initialize AI Voice Changer engine
    aiVoiceChanger->initEngine();
    ```

### 4 Update AI Voice Changer Engine Model

Call the [IZegoAIVoiceChanger.update](@update-IZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to update the AI Voice Changer engine model. **The AI Voice Changer engine model file is relatively large, and the first update will take a long time. Please be patient.**

```cpp
// Update AI Voice Changer engine model
aiVoiceChanger->update();
```

### 5 Get Timbre List

Call the [IZegoAIVoiceChanger.getSpeakerList](@getSpeakerList-IZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to get the list of available timbres.

The list of available timbres will be returned through the [IZegoAIVoiceChangerEventHandler.onGetSpeakerList](@onGetSpeakerList-IZegoAIVoiceChangerEventHandler) callback interface.

```cpp
// Get list of available timbres
aiVoiceChanger->getSpeakerList();
```

### 6 Set Target Timbre

Call the [IZegoAIVoiceChanger.setSpeaker](@setSpeaker-IZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to set the timbre. The choice of timbre can be obtained through [5 Get Timbre List](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/audio/ai-voice-changer).

Setting the timbre ID to 0 indicates using the original voice.

```cpp
// Set timbre
int speakerID = 0; // Timbre ID
aiVoiceChanger->setSpeaker(speakerID);
```

### 7 Destroy AI Voice Changer Engine Instance

After using the feature, call the [destroyAIVoiceChanger](@destroyAIVoiceChanger) interface to destroy the AI Voice Changer engine instance and release resources such as microphones.

```cpp
// Destroy AI Voice Changer engine instance
engine.destroyAIVoiceChanger(aiVoiceChanger);
```

## Notes

After completing the above steps, before deploying the application, you need to deploy the `cacert.pem` file in the SDK to the same directory as the application main program, otherwise the AI Voice Changer feature cannot be used normally.
