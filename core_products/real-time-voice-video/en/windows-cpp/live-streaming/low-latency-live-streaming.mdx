# Ultra-Low Latency Live Streaming

---

## Feature Introduction

ZEGO [Ultra-Low Latency Live Streaming](/live-streaming-ios/introduction/overview) (Low-Latency Live Streaming, L3) is built for high-quality experience, creating the ultimate live streaming experience with ultra-low latency, ultra-strong synchronization, extreme weak network resistance, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and first-frame instant start. It is a "hexagonal warrior" among live streaming distribution products.

Compared to traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO Ultra-Low Latency Live Streaming is based on full-link self-developed private protocols, Massive Sequential Data Network (MSDN), and end-to-end monitoring, providing more stable and higher quality live streaming distribution services, helping business solve "live streaming experience" pain points, and is the common choice of many leading live streaming customers.

<Warning title="Attention">
The ultra-low latency stream playing feature is not enabled by default. Please contact ZEGO Technical Support to enable the feature before use.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing ultra-low latency live streaming functionality, ensure that:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK into your project and implemented basic audio and video stream publishing and playing functionality. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/implementing-video-call).

## Usage Steps

Set the "resourceMode" parameter of [ZegoPlayerConfig](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~CPP_windows~struct~zego-express-zego-player-config) to "ZEGO_STREAM_RESOURCE_MODE_ONLY_L3", and call the [startPlayingStream](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~cpp_windows~class~IZegoExpressEngine#start-playing-stream-1) interface to play remote pushed ultra-low latency live streaming streams based on the passed stream ID parameter "streamID", to achieve ultra-low latency live streaming functionality.

```cpp
ZegoPlayerConfig playerConfig;
playerConfig.resourceMode = ZEGO_STREAM_RESOURCE_MODE_ONLY_L3;
engine->startPlayingStream(streamID, &playCanvas, playerConfig);
```
