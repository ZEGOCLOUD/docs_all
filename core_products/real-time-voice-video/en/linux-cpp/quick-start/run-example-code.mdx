# Running Example Source Code

---


<Warning title="Note">


This example source code is a simple command-line program. You can refer to the cross-platform desktop C++ [Example Source Code Documentation](/real-time-video-windows-cpp/quick-start/run-example-code) to get richer Qt example source code.

</Warning>

This article introduces how to quickly run through the example source code and experience basic audio/video call services.

## Prepare Environment

Before starting to integrate ZEGO Express SDK, please ensure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Any Linux distribution system with GLIBC 2.16 or higher version, supporting x86_64, aarch64, armhf, armel architectures.
- libasound (ALSA).
- libv4l2 (v4l utils).
- CMake 3.7 or higher version.

<Note title="Description">
- SDK depends on libasound (ALSA) and libv4l2 (v4l utils).
- CentOS (RHEL/Fedora) can be installed by executing `yum install alsa-lib-devel libv4l-devel` command.
- Ubuntu (Debian/Deepin) can be installed by executing `apt install libasound2-dev libv4l-dev` command.
- For other platforms and systems, please install by yourself.
- If cross-compilation is needed, please refer to [How to cross-compile Linux alsa-lib dependency library?](http://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/alsa_lib_cross_compile?product=ExpressAudio&platform=linux) and [How to cross-compile Linux v4l-utils dependency library?](http://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/v4l_utils_cross_compile?product=ExpressVideo&platform=linux) documents. At the same time, the target machine needs to have libasound and libv4l2 dependency libraries installed.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

You have created a project in the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to "Project Information" in [Console - Project Management](/console/project-info).

<Warning title="Note">
SDK also supports Token authentication. If you need to upgrade the authentication method, please refer to [How to upgrade from AppSign authentication to Token authentication](/console/project-info).
</Warning>

### Example Source Code Directory Structure

The following structure is the file structure of the project directory. The file paths involved below are all relative to this directory.

```tree

```

### Before Building Example Source Code, Check Whether Dependencies Are Satisfied

Find the directory of SDK Native dynamic libraries for the corresponding architecture (i.e., the directory storing `libZegoExpressEngine.so`), open a terminal and execute the following command to check the output. If there is information such as `not found`, it means dependencies are not satisfied. Please check and install missing dependencies.

<Note title="Description">


This project is a CMake project. You can use `VS Code` or any other IDE to open the `./ZegoExpressExample` directory to view the source code.

</Note>

```sh
$ ldd libZegoExpressEngine.so
```

### Method 1: Native Compilation (supports x86_64, aarch64, armhf and armel)

1. Execute `cd ./ZegoExpressExample` command to enter the project root directory (i.e., the directory where the "main.cpp" file is located).

2. Generate Makefile to the "build" directory of the current directory through CMake.

    ```sh
    $ cmake -B"build"
    ```

3. Compile the example code project through Make.

    ```sh
    $ make -C ./build
    ```

### Method 2: Cross-Compilation

1. Currently supports cross-compiling for aarch64, armhf or armel target platforms in x86_64 environment (if you need to support other environments, please modify the configuration in `CMakeLists.txt` by yourself).

2. Confirm that your machine has installed gcc/g++ for cross-compilation for the target platform. The following assumes cross-compilation for aarch64 target platform.

3. Execute `export TARGET_LINUX_ARCH=aarch64`. This environment variable is for `CMakeLists.txt` to identify the current target platform to build.

4. Generate Makefile to the "build" directory of the current directory through CMake.

    ```sh
    $ cmake -B"build"
    ```

5. Compile the example code project through Make.

    ```sh
    $ make -C ./build
    ```

## Run Example Source Code

1. After successful build, the executable binary file of the example code will be generated to the "./ZegoExpressExample/out" directory.

2. Open a terminal, execute the executable binary file of the example code, and then continue operating according to the printed help information.

    The running effect is as follows:

## Experience Real-Time Audio/Video Functions

Run the project on a real device. After successful running, you can see the local video image.

For convenience of experience, ZEGO provides a [Web Debug Example](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html). On this page, enter the same AppID and RoomID, enter different UserIDs, and the corresponding [Token](/console/development-assistance/temporary-token), then you can join the same room to interoperate with the real device. When the audio/video call starts successfully, you can hear the remote audio and see the remote video image.
