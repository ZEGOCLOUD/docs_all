# Integrating SDK

- - -

## Prepare Environment

Before starting to integrate ZEGO Express SDK, please ensure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Any Linux distribution system with GLIBC 2.16 or higher version, supporting x86_64, aarch64, armhf, armel architectures.
- libasound (ALSA).
- libv4l2 (v4l utils).
- CMake 3.7 or higher version.

<Note title="Description">

- SDK depends on libasound (ALSA) and libv4l2 (v4l utils).
- CentOS (RHEL/Fedora) can be installed by executing `yum install alsa-lib-devel libv4l` command.
- Ubuntu (Debian/Deepin) can be installed by executing `apt install libasound2-dev libv4l-dev` command.
- For other platforms and systems, please install by yourself.
- If cross-compilation is needed, please refer to [How to cross-compile Linux alsa-lib dependency library?](http://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/alsa_lib_cross_compile?product=ExpressAudio&platform=linux) and [How to cross-compile Linux v4l-utils dependency library?](http://doc-zh.zego.im/faq/v4l_utils_cross_compile?product=ExpressVideo&platform=linux) documents. At the same time, the target machine needs to have libasound and libv4l2 dependency libraries installed.

</Note>



When integrating SDK using Qt + qmake, please download any version of [Qt](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt) between 5.9 and 5.15. For detailed information, please refer to [Getting Started with Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html).

## Integrating SDK

1. Please download the latest version of SDK through the [Download](/real-time-video-linux-cpp/client-sdk/download-sdk) documentation.

    It is recommended to refer to the project in [Running Example Source Code](/real-time-video-linux-cpp/quick-start/run-example-code) to integrate SDK.

2. Decompress the SDK, and copy all contents under the "release/Library" directory to your project.

    - **When integrating SDK using CMake, please import SDK according to the following process**

        Introduce SDK in the "CMakeLists.txt" file of your project.

        ```cmake
        cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7)
        project(MyAwesomeProject)

        # Add header search path
        include_directories("./libs/zego/include")
        # Add lib search path
        link_directories("./libs/zego")
        # Link SDK
        link_libraries(ZegoExpressEngine rt)

        add_compile_options(
        -std=c++11
        )

        aux_source_directory(./src SRC_LIST)

        add_executable(MyAwesomeProject ${SRC_LIST})
        ```

    - **When integrating SDK using Qt + qmake, please import SDK according to the following process**

        Add the following configuration in the `<project_name>.pro` file of your project to import SDK library and header files.

        ```qmake
        unix {
            contains(QT_ARCH, arm64) {
                INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/aarch64/include
                DEPENDPATH  += $$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/aarch64/include
                LIBS += -L$$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/aarch64 -lZegoExpressEngine
            } else:contains(QT_ARCH, arm) {
                INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/armhf/include
                DEPENDPATH  += $$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/armhf/include
                LIBS += -L$$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/armhf -lZegoExpressEngine
            } else { # Assume other archs are x86_64
                INCLUDEPATH += $$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/x86_64/include
                DEPENDPATH  += $$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/x86_64/include
                LIBS += -L$$PWD/../libs/ZegoExpress/linux/x86_64 -lZegoExpressEngine
            }
        }
        ```
3. (Optional) The Linux SDK does not block the SIGPIPE signal. Developers need to choose whether to block the SIGPIPE signal according to the actual situation during actual development.

<Warning title="Note">


    In most cases, you need to block this signal, otherwise the client process will exit by default after receiving this signal. You can also directly ignore this signal: `signal(SIGPIPE,SIG_IGN);`.

</Warning>



    ```cpp
    static void ExceptionSigHandler(int signum)
     {
         char exitSignalStr[1024] = {0};
         sprintf(exitSignalStr,"exception signal : %d",signum);
         log("------------------------------");
         log(exitSignalStr);
         log("------------------------------");
     }
     int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
         signal(SIGPIPE, ExceptionSigHandler);
         // your code

         return 0;
     }
    ```
