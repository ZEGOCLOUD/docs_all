# Ultra-Low Latency Live Streaming

---

## Feature Overview



ZEGO [Ultra-Low Latency Live Streaming](/live-streaming-ios/introduction/overview) (Low-Latency Live Streaming, L3) is born for high-quality experience. It can create an ultimate live streaming experience with ultra-low latency, super strong synchronization, extreme weak network resistance, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and first-frame second-open. It is a "hexagonal warrior" among live streaming distribution products.

Compared with traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming is based on full-link self-developed private protocol, massive ordered data network (MSDN), and end-to-end monitoring, providing more stable and higher quality live streaming distribution services, helping the business side solve "live streaming experience" pain points, and is the common choice of many leading live streaming customers.

<Warning title="Note">


The ultra-low latency stream playing function is not enabled by default. Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable the function before using.

### Feature Highlights

Ultra-low latency live streaming supports tens of millions of ultra-large concurrency, providing stable and high-quality live streaming distribution services with the following 6 major high-quality features:

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Feature</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-Low Latency</td>
<td>Live streaming latency of 600 ms ～ 1000 ms under normal network conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Super Strong Synchronization
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level synchronization, synchronization error between different viewers < 400ms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extreme Weak Network Resistance</td>
<td>Supports extreme weak network resistance, up to 80% packet loss without disconnection, stable playback even in complex network environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-Low Stuttering</td>
<td>Compared with CDN live streaming, using ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming can reduce the stuttering rate by up to 75% or more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-Clear Picture Quality</td>
<td>Through the All-in-one SDK, it provides rich picture quality optimization capabilities to achieve user-level high-quality picture quality practices in various scenarios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First-Frame Second-Open</td>
<td>Using an exclusive decoupled low-level architecture and providing second-open strategies such as preloading live streams, supports viewers to enter the room at extreme speed, achieving up to 99% domestic second-open rate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


### Application Scenarios

Ultra-low latency live streaming can be applied to the following scenarios:

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Application Scenario</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Overseas Live Streaming
</td>
<td>
Break through pain points such as high stuttering, slow first frame, and poor picture quality one by one, improve the live streaming experience of global audiences, and enable global users to enjoy live streaming social interaction.
Break through bottlenecks such as poor overseas network environments, high proportion of mid-to-low-end devices, and poor broadcasting environments of amateur anchors, helping enterprises with overseas localization.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Showcase Live Streaming</td>
<td>Provide essential showcase live streaming functions such as second-open and beauty effects, support seamless switching solutions for multiple scenarios such as cross-room PK and live streaming to 1V1.
While ensuring the live streaming viewing experience of all viewers, focus on ensuring the experience quality of big anchors and paid users, effectively promoting the growth of paid users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Education Large Class
</td>
<td>Ultra-low latency online classroom perfectly compatible with diverse teaching plugins, providing excellent teacher-student interactive experience, making students' classroom progress consistent with teachers, and teaching immersion comparable to offline classrooms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gaming Live Streaming</td>
<td>In gaming scenarios with high bitrate, it can adaptively transcode according to viewer bandwidth, effectively reducing the stuttering rate so that all viewers can smoothly watch game interactions. Based on high-definition low-bitrate, it effectively improves game picture quality at the same bitrate, not limited by viewer network bottlenecks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Event Live Streaming
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level latency and ultra-low stuttering, say goodbye to being spoiled, grasp the dynamic situation on the field in real time, and never miss any highlight moments. Supports 4K 60fps and HDR, presenting rich field details and silky ultra-clear dynamic pictures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E-commerce Live Streaming</td>
<td>Match the strong real-time requirements of shopping with goods. Anchors can respond to viewers' shopping consultations at extreme speed, improving the stickiness between anchors and viewers.
Achieve strong synchronization and fairness for activities such as auctions, flash sales, and limited-time offers, stimulating user order conversion in the live room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Watch Together</td>
<td>Global massive audiences can synchronously watch movies, concerts, or competitive matches in the same live room. Low-latency, multi-terminal synchronized audio and video experience helps users communicate at zero distance without obstacles, bringing an immersive viewing experience.</td>
</tr>

## Prerequisites

Before using ultra-low latency live streaming, please ensure that you have implemented basic audio and video publishing and playing functions in the project. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-linux-cpp/quick-start/integrating-sdk) related documentation.

## Usage Steps

Set the `resourceMode` parameter of [ZegoPlayerConfig](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~CPP_linux~struct~zego-express-zego-player-config#zego-player-config) to `ZEGO_STREAM_RESOURCE_MODE_ONLY_L3`, and call the [startPlayingStream](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~CPP_linux~class~zego-express-i-zego-express-engine#start-playing-stream) interface. According to the passed Stream ID parameter `streamID`, pull the ultra-low latency live streaming stream pushed remotely, to achieve the ultra-low latency live streaming function.

```cpp
ZegoPlayerConfig playerConfig;
playerConfig.resourceMode = ZEGO_STREAM_RESOURCE_MODE_ONLY_L3;
engine->startPlayingStream(streamID, &playCanvas, playerConfig);
```
