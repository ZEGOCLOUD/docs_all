<Note title="Notes">

- If you need to use the SDK with whiteboard features, you can download the "Super Board SDK" from [Super Board - Download SDK](/super-board-ios/download-sdk). This SDK already includes the ZegoExpress-Video SDK (with whiteboard features), so there is no need to download it separately.
- If you need to use the SDK with copyright music features, please download it from [Online KTV - Download SDK](/online-ktv-ios/downloads).
- Example source code: Please refer to [Download Example Source Code](/real-time-video-ios-swift/quick-start/run-example-code).
- SDK version changes: Please refer to [Release Notes](/real-time-video-ios-oc/client-sdk/release-notes). The iOS-Swift platform and iOS-Objective-C platform share the same set of SDK interfaces.
