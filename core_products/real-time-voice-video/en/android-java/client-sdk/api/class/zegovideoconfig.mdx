# ZegoVideoConfig

## ZegoVideoConfig

Video config.

**Details**

Configure parameters used for publishing stream, such as bitrate, frame rate, and resolution.
 Developers should note that the width and height resolution of the mobile and desktop are opposite. For example, 360p, the resolution of the mobile is 360x640, and the desktop is 640x360.
 When using external capture, the capture and encoding resolution of RTC cannot be set to 0*0, otherwise, there will be no video data in the publishing stream in the entire engine life cycle.

*Declared in `entity/ZegoVideoConfig.java`*

### Properties
<ParamField
  name="captureWidth"
  prototype="public int captureWidth"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
Capture resolution width, control the width of camera image acquisition. SDK requires this member to be set to an even number. Only the camera is not started and the custom video capture is not used, the setting is effective. For performance reasons, the SDK scales the video frame to the encoding resolution after capturing from camera and before rendering to the preview view. Therefore, the resolution of the preview image is the encoding resolution. If you need the resolution of the preview image to be this value, Please call [setCapturePipelineScaleMode] first to change the capture pipeline scale mode to [Post]
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="captureHeight"
  prototype="public int captureHeight"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
Capture resolution height, control the height of camera image acquisition. SDK requires this member to be set to an even number. Only the camera is not started and the custom video capture is not used, the setting is effective. For performance reasons, the SDK scales the video frame to the encoding resolution after capturing from camera and before rendering to the preview view.

</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="encodeWidth"
  prototype="public int encodeWidth"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
Encode resolution width, control the image width of the encoder when publishing stream. SDK requires this member to be set to an even number. The settings before and after publishing stream can be effective
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="encodeHeight"
  prototype="public int encodeHeight"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
Encode resolution height, control the image height of the encoder when publishing stream. SDK requires this member to be set to an even number. The settings before and after publishing stream can be effective
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="fps"
  prototype="public int fps"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
Frame rate, control the frame rate of the camera and the frame rate of the encoder. Publishing stream set to 60 fps, playing stream to take effect need contact technical support
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="bitrate"
  prototype="public int bitrate"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
Bit rate in kbps. The settings before and after publishing stream can be effective. The SDK will automatically set the bit rate suitable for the scenario selected by the developer. If the bit rate manually set by the developer exceeds the reasonable range, the SDK will automatically process the bit rate according to the reasonable range. If you need to configure a high bit rate due to business needs, please contact ZEGO Business.
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="codecID"
  prototype="public [ZegoVideoCodecID](../../api-reference/enum#zegovideocodecid) codecID"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
The codec id to be used, the default value is [default]. Settings only take effect before publishing stream
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  name="keyFrameInterval"
  prototype="public int keyFrameInterval"
  parent_name="ZegoVideoConfig"
  parent_type="class">
<Note title="">
- **Required**: No. 
- **Default value**: 2 seconds. 
- **Value range**: [2, 5]. 
- **Caution**: The setting is only valid before pushing.
</Note>
