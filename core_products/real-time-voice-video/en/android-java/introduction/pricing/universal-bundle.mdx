## 3 Consumption Method

<Warning title="Warning">

The Universal Bundle does not support refunds after being added.

</Warning>

1. The Universal Bundle takes effect immediately in the current month after purchase and addition.
2. The Universal Bundle is uniformly consumed at the end of each month, not consumed daily.
3. The validity period of the Universal Bundle is "added month - the month before next year". For example, if the Universal Bundle is added on 2021-03-15, its validity period is from 2021-03-01 to 2022-02-28.
4. Universal Bundles can be purchased in stacking, and the bundle that expires first is consumed first.
If the expiration time is the same, the bundle with the smaller discount is consumed first.
5. The consumption order of Universal Bundles is as follows: Audio > SD Standard Definition Video > HD High Definition Video > HD+ Ultra-High Definition Video. Only when one tier is fully deducted will the next tier be deducted. (Video Call above 1080p does not currently support using Universal Bundle)
6. In order not to affect the normal operation of the business, when all Universal Bundles are used up or expired, the usage exceeding the Universal Bundle will be paid post-paid at the list price.
7. Once all Universal Bundle duration has been used for consumption deduction, it cannot be restored.
8. Once all Universal Bundles expire, all minutes will be cleared to zero and cannot be restored.
9. All Universal Bundles will be invoiced according to needs after purchase.


## 4 Billing Example

Assume the user purchased a 250,000-minute Universal Bundle in March, and generated the following Video Call usage data in March:

| Audio (minutes) | SD Standard Definition (minutes) | HD High Definition (minutes)| HD+ Ultra-High Definition (minutes)|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |---- |
| 20000 | 20000 | 20000 | 10000 |

At the end of March, the ZEGO system will consume the Universal Bundle for the current month's usage (consumption order is: Audio > SD Standard Definition Video > HD High Definition Video > HD+ Ultra-High Definition Video. Only when the usage of a certain tier has consumed all Universal Bundles will the next tier be consumed). The bundle billing for the above example is:

1. Consume audio duration: 250000 - 20000 × 1 = 230000 (minutes);
2. Consume SD standard definition video duration: 230000 - 20000 × 1.7 = 196000 (minutes);
3. Consume HD high definition video duration: 196000 - 20000 × 3.6 = 124000 (minutes);
4. Consume HD+ ultra-high definition video duration: 124000 - 10000 × 14 = -16000 (minutes);
5. At this time, there is a remaining "-16000" (minutes) Universal Duration difference. Since the difference occurs in the HD+ ultra-high definition video tier, it needs to be recalculated back to HD+ ultra-high definition video duration. That is 16000 ÷ 14 = 1142.86 (minutes).


<Note title="Notes">

In this example, when consuming to the HD+ ultra-high definition video tier:

There are 124000 (minutes) remaining Universal Bundle duration, so the consumable HD+ high definition video duration is 124000 ÷ 14 = 8857.14 (minutes).

The duration exceeding consumption of HD+ ultra-high definition video is 10000 - 8857.14 = 1142.86 (minutes), and the excess part will be charged at the normal list price.

</Note>


That is, the 250,000-minute Universal Bundle in March was completely consumed, exceeding the consumption of 1142 minutes of HD+ ultra-high definition video, which will be charged at the normal list price.
