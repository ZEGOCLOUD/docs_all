# Server-side Stream Mixing Pricing

---

## Usage Statistics Method

The usage of the stream mixing service is calculated based on the output resolution of the mixed stream set by the developer and the duration of stream mixing transcoding. Developers can specify multiple audio and video streams for mixing, and specify the encoding method and resolution of the mixed output.

- Billing tiers are divided according to the transcoding resolution and encoding method set by the developer.
- Calculated based on the actual duration of audio and video output through the stream mixing service.
- The mixed audio and video streams need to be published to the stream mixing server first, which will generate the cost of real-time audio and video streams.
- Supports specifying a single audio and video stream for mixing.

<Note title="Note">

**Precision Note:**
 - Duration usage precision is in seconds. When billing, the accumulated seconds in the billing cycle are converted into minutes for statistics. Less than one minute is counted as one minute, and the final billing is based on the number of minutes.

**Stream Mixing Note:**

 - Calculated based on the duration from the start of stream mixing transcoding to the end of stream mixing transcoding.
 - The encoding method refers to the video coding standard set by the developer for stream mixing.
 - If multiple mixed audio and video outputs are output at the same time, the usage needs to be calculated cumulatively.

## Billing Examples


Use ZEGOCLOUD server-side stream mixing service for stream mixing. The encoding method is H.264, and the outputs are:
Standard Definition Video (SD) 200 minutes, High Definition Video (HD) 100 minutes, Full HD Video (HD+) 50 minutes, High-quality Audio Only 400 minutes.

|Encoding Method|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Cost (RMB)|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Audio Mixing|High-quality Audio Only|High-quality Audio Only mixing unit price * Output High-quality Audio Only duration|7.00 × 400 / 1000|2.80|
|H.264|Standard Definition Video (SD)|Standard Definition Video (SD) mixing unit price * Output Standard Definition Video (SD) duration|12.00 × 200 / 1000|2.40|
|H.264|High Definition Video (HD)|High Definition Video (HD) mixing unit price * Output High Definition Video (HD) duration|25.00 × 100 / 1000|2.50|
|H.264|Full HD Video (HD+)|Full HD Video (HD+) mixing unit price * Output Full HD Video (HD+) duration|98.00 × 50 / 1000|4.90|

The total cost generated by using **Server-side Stream Mixing Service** = **High-quality Audio Only** mixing cost + **Standard Definition Video (SD)** mixing cost + **High Definition Video (HD)** mixing cost + **Full HD Video (HD+)** mixing cost = 2.80 + 2.40 + 2.50 + 4.90 = 12.60 RMB.
