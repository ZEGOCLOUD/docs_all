# Video Call Pricing

---

## Usage Statistics Method

The usage of the Video Call service is calculated based on the actual duration of users playing audio and video streams.

- If a user does not play audio streams and video streams in the room, no fee will be charged.
- When a user plays a stream that contains both video data and audio data, the video duration is calculated only once, and the audio duration is not calculated separately.
- When a user plays multiple video streams, the video duration at different resolutions is calculated separately. The resolution of multiple video screens will not be added together, and there will be no video tier jumping in usage statistics.

<Note title="Note">


- **Precision Note:** Duration usage precision is in seconds. When billing, the accumulated seconds in the billing cycle are converted into minutes for statistics. Less than one minute is counted as one minute, and the final billing is based on the number of minutes.

- **Stream Playing Note:**

     - Audio and video stream playing refers to users obtaining "audio and video data streams" through clients (or other terminals).
     - Calculated based on the duration from when the user starts playing the stream to when the user stops playing the stream.
     - Billing tiers are divided according to the resolution of the audio and video streams played by the user.

- **Usage Statistics:** You can log in to the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/) to query information such as your video usage duration. For details, please refer to [Console - Usage Statistics](/console/usage-statistics).

## Billing Examples

### Co-hosting Room

Assume that users A and B stay in the room together for 20 minutes. Both A and B do not receive video screens, only playing each other's **High-quality Audio Only** stream, that is, A plays B's audio stream, and B plays A's audio stream.

Cost calculation:

|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Cost (RMB)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High-quality Audio Only|High-quality audio only duration unit price × Sum of high-quality audio only stream duration played by all users|7.00 x (20 + 20) / 1,000 |0.28|

The **Total Video Call Cost** generated by this room is 0.28 RMB.


### Video Interaction Room

Assume that users A and B stay in the room together for 20 minutes. A only turns on the microphone, and B turns on the camera. A plays B's **Standard Definition Video (SD)** screen, and B plays A's **High-quality Audio Only**.


Cost calculation:

|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Cost (RMB)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High-quality Audio Only|High-quality audio only duration unit price × Sum of high-quality audio only duration played by all users|7.00 × 20 / 1,000 |0.14|
|Standard Definition Video (SD)|Standard Definition Video (SD) duration unit price × Sum of Standard Definition Video (SD) duration played by all users|12.00 × 20 / 1,000 |0.24|

The **Total Video Call Cost** generated by this room = **High-quality Audio Only** cost + **Standard Definition Video (SD)** cost = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 RMB.


### Multi-stream Video Interaction Room

Assume that users A, B, C, D, and E stay in the room together for 20 minutes. A plays **Standard Definition Video (SD) screens** of B, C, D, and E. B, C, and D play A's **High Definition Video (HD)** screens and **Standard Definition Video (SD)** screens of the other three people. E does not play any stream in the first 10 minutes, and plays A's **High Definition Video (HD)** screen and **High-quality Audio Only** of the other three people in the last 10 minutes.


Stream playing duration calculation:

|Billing Tier|A Playing Duration (minutes)|B Playing Duration (minutes)|C Playing Duration (minutes)|D Playing Duration (minutes)|E Playing Duration (minutes)|Total Duration (minutes)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|High-quality Audio Only|0|0|0|0|10 × 3|30|
|Standard Definition Video (SD)|20 × 4|20 × 3|20 × 3|20 × 3|0|260|
|High Definition Video (HD)|0|20|20|20|10|70|


Cost calculation:

|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Cost (RMB)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High-quality Audio Only|High-quality audio only duration unit price × Sum of high-quality audio only duration played by all users|7.00 × 30 / 1,000 |0.21|
|Standard Definition Video (SD)|Standard Definition Video (SD) duration unit price × Sum of Standard Definition Video (SD) duration played by all users|12.00 × 260 / 1,000 |3.12|
|High Definition Video (HD)|High Definition Video (HD) duration unit price × Sum of High Definition Video (HD) duration played by all users|25.00 × 70 / 1,000 | 1.75|

The **Total Video Call Cost** generated by this room = **High-quality Audio Only** cost + **Standard Definition Video (SD)** cost + **High Definition Video (HD)** cost = 0.21 + 3.12 + 1.75 = 5.08 RMB.
