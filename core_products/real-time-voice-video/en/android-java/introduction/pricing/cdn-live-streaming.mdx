# CDN Live Streaming Pricing

- - -

## Usage Statistics Method

CDN currently defaults to postpaid pay-as-you-go billing, and provides two billing types: bandwidth billing and traffic billing. You can choose the appropriate billing mode based on your business form.

For the billing overview and price details of CDN, please refer to "Service Pricing" below.

## Service Pricing

|Billing Tier|Billing Type|Tier Description|Price|
|-|-|-|-|
|(0Mbps,500Mbps]|Bandwidth |Monthly Peak Bandwidth|26 RMB/Mbps/month|
|(500Mbps,2Gbps]|Bandwidth |Monthly Peak Bandwidth|24 RMB/Mbps/month|
|(2Gbps,∞]|Bandwidth |Monthly Peak Bandwidth|22 RMB/Mbps/month|
|Un-tiered Usage|Traffic|Cumulative Stream Playing|0.5 RMB/GB|

<Note title="Note">


- Each CDN node records traffic data in real time and reports it to the calculation center, which is summarized into the total traffic data of the domain.
- Monthly peak bandwidth: Billed based on the peak bandwidth of each month. One bandwidth data is counted every 5 minutes, and about 8640 values are obtained each month, taking the maximum value.
- System conversion rules: 1 GB = 1000 MB, 1 MB= 1000 KB, 1 Gbps = 1000 Mbps, 1 Mbps = 1000 Kbps.
- The monthly settlement month is the natural month.
- If you have signed a contract with sales, the content of the contract shall prevail.
- All fees include tax.

## Billing Examples

### Bandwidth Billing Example

Assume that the CDN monthly peak bandwidth of last month is X Mbps. The tiered calculation method is as follows:
- If X ≤ 500 Mbps, the bill cost is X * 26 RMB. For example, when the CDN peak bandwidth of last month is 400 Mbps, the bill cost is 400 * 26 = 10400 RMB.
- If 500 Mbps ＜ X ≤ 2 Gbps, the bill cost is X * 24 RMB. For example, when the CDN peak bandwidth of last month is 1000 Mbps, the bill cost is 1000 * 24 = 24000 RMB.
- If X ＞ 2 Gbps, the bill cost is X * 22 RMB. For example, when the CDN peak bandwidth of last month is 3000 Mbps, the bill cost is 3000 * 22 = 66000 RMB


### Traffic Billing Example

Assume that the CDN traffic consumption of last month is Y GB, then the cost consumption of last month is: Y * 0.5 RMB. For example, when the traffic consumption of last month is 1000 GB, the bill cost is 1000 * 0.5 = 500 RMB
