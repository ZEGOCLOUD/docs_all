# Usage Restrictions

This article introduces the usage restrictions of the ZEGO Express SDK Room service, including frequency limits, string sizes, etc.

## Room

The ZEGO Room service supports up to one million users online simultaneously in a single Room. The default total login QPS for all users in each Room is 200, which means a maximum of 200 users can log in to the same Room per second.

If you need to increase the limit, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for evaluation.
