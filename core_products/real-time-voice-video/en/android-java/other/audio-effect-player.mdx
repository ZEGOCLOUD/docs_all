# Audio Effect Player

- - -

## Feature Overview

Audio effects mainly refer to short sound effects played to enhance realism or set the atmosphere of a scene. For example: during live streaming, there are often scenes for playing sound effects, such as applause, gift sound effects, prompt sounds, etc. In games, sometimes it is also necessary to play bullet sounds, collision impact sounds, etc.

The Audio Effect Player (ZegoAudioEffectPlayer) provided by ZEGO Express SDK uniformly manages audio effects, supports audio effect playing (multiple audio effects can be played at the same time), playback control (such as pausing playback, volume adjustment, setting playback progress), audio effect preloading, and other functions.

## Example Source Code Download

Please refer to [Download Example Source Code](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/run-example-code) to get the source code.

For related source code, please check the files in the "/ZegoExpressExample/AdvancedAudioProcessing/src/main/java/im/zego/advancedaudioprocessing/audioeffectplayer" directory.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the audio effect player function, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio and video publish and play stream functionality. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Usage Steps

### 1 Create audio effect player

Call the [createAudioEffectPlayer](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine#create-audio-effect-player) method of [ZegoExpressEngine](@-ZegoExpressEngine) to create an audio effect player instance.

<Warning title="Attention">
The engine currently only supports creating one instance at the same time. Beyond that, `null` will be returned.
</Warning>

```java
ZegoAudioEffectPlayer audioEffectPlayer = ZegoExpressEngine.getEngine().createAudioEffectPlayer();
```

### 2 (Optional) Preload resources

<Accordion title="Preload resources" defaultOpen="false">
In scenarios where the same audio effect is played frequently, in order to optimize the performance of repeatedly reading and decoding files, the SDK provides the function of preloading audio effect files into memory.

Call the [loadResource](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#load-resource) method to load audio effect resources. You can listen to the loading result through the "callback" parameter and play it after the loading is successful. It supports preloading up to 15 local audio effect files at the same time (network resources are not supported), and the duration of a single audio effect file cannot exceed 30s, otherwise the loading will report an error.

When the loaded audio effect is used up, you can call the [unloadResource](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#unload-resource) interface to unload it to release related resources. Otherwise, the SDK will automatically unload the loaded audio effects when the [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer](@-ZegoAudioEffectPlayer) instance is released.


<Note title="Note">
Preloading is not a required operation. It is recommended to use it to improve performance or when you need to repeatedly play a specific audio effect.
</Note>


```java
// Load audio effect resources
audioEffectPlayer.loadResource(audioEffectID, "/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/im.zego.express.example.video/files/3-s.mp3", new IZegoAudioEffectPlayerLoadResourceCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onLoadResourceCallback(int i) {
        Log.d("[ZEGO]", "onLoadResourceCallback errorCode:" + i );

    }
});

// Unload audio effect resources
audioEffectPlayer.unloadResource(audioEffectID);
```
</Accordion>

### 3 Playback control

#### (Optional) Set event callback for audio effect player

<Accordion title="Audio effect player event callback setting" defaultOpen="false">
You can call the [setEventHandler](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#set-event-handler) method of the audio effect player as needed to set event callbacks for the player to listen to notifications such as "audio effect playback status change".

```java
audioEffectPlayer.setEventHandler(new IZegoAudioEffectPlayerEventHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onAudioEffectPlayStateUpdate(ZegoAudioEffectPlayer audioEffectPlayer, int audioEffectID, ZegoAudioEffectPlayState state, int errorCode) {
                        Log.d("[ZEGO]", "onAudioEffectPlayStateUpdate errorCode:" + errorCode + "  audioEffectID:" + audioEffectID + "  state:" + state);
    }
});
```
</Accordion>


#### Start playing

Call the [start](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#start) method to play audio effects. Currently, it only supports playing up to 12 audio effects at the same time, and can only be local files, not network resources. "audioEffectID" needs to be globally unique.

* If you have preloaded the audio effect through the [loadResource](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#load-resource) method, you only need to pass in the "audioEffectID" during preloading, and pass in an empty string for the "path" (path of audio effect resources) field.
* If you need to repeat playback, you can configure the number of repetitions through "playCount" in [ZegoAudioEffectPlayConfig](@-ZegoAudioEffectPlayConfig). If set to "0", it means infinite loop playback until the user manually calls [stop](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#stop) to stop.

```java
int audioEffectID = 1;
ZegoAudioEffectPlayConfig config = new ZegoAudioEffectPlayConfig();
config.playCount = 10;
config.isPublishOut = true;
audioEffectPlayer.start(audioEffectID,"/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/im.zego.express.example.video/files/3-s.mp3",config);

```

#### Pause/Resume/Stop playback

1. Call the [pause](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#pause) method to pause the audio effect specified by "audioEffectID", and call the [pauseAll](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#pause-all) method to pause all playing audio effects.
2. After the audio effect is paused, call the [resume](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#resume) method to resume the audio effect specified by "audioEffectID", and call the [resumeAll](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#resume-all) method to resume all paused audio effects.
3. Call the [stop](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#stop) method to stop the audio effect specified by "audioEffectID", and call the [stopAll](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#stop-all) method to stop all audio effects.

```java
audioEffectPlayer.pause(audioEffectID);
audioEffectPlayer.resume(audioEffectID);
audioEffectPlayer.stop(audioEffectID);
audioEffectPlayer.pauseAll();
audioEffectPlayer.resumeAll();
audioEffectPlayer.stopAll();
```

#### Adjust volume

1. Call the [setVolume](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#set-volume) method to set the volume of the audio effect specified by "audioEffectID". The value range is [0, 200], and the default value is "100".
2. Call the [setVolumeAll](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#set-volume-all) method to set the volume of all audio effects at the same time. The value range is [0, 200], and the default value is "100".

```java
int volume =70;
audioEffectPlayer.setVolume(audioEffectID, volume);

// Set the volume of all audio effects
audioEffectPlayer.setVolumeAll(volume);
```

#### Playback progress control

1. Call the [getTotalDuration](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#get-total-duration) method to get the total duration of a single audio effect.
2. Call the [getCurrentProgress](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#get-current-progress) method to get the current playback progress of the audio effect.
3. Call the [seekTo](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-audio-effect-player#seek-to) method to set the playback progress as needed.

```java
// Get the total duration of the audio effect
long totalDuration = audioEffectPlayer.getTotalDuration(audioEffectID);
// Get the current playback progress of the audio effect
long progress = audioEffectPlayer.getCurrentProgress(audioEffectID);
// Set playback progress
audioEffectPlayer.seekTo(audioEffectID, 1, new IZegoAudioEffectPlayerSeekToCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSeekToCallback(int errorCode) {
        Log.d("[ZEGO]", "onSeekToCallback errorCode:" + errorCode);
    }
});
```


### 4 Destroy audio effect player

After using the audio effect player, you need to call the [destroyAudioEffectPlayer](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine#destroy-audio-effect-player) method in time to destroy it and release the resources occupied by the player.

```java
engine.destroyAudioEffectPlayer(audioEffectPlayer);
```
