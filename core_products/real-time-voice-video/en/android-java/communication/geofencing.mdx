# Geofencing

- - -

## Feature Overview
Geofencing refers to limiting the transmission of audio, video, and signaling data to a certain region to comply with regional data privacy and security regulations, that is, limiting access to audio and video services in a specific region. For example, when the specified geofencing region is Europe, regardless of where the App users are located, the region actually accessed by the SDK will be Europe.

<Warning title="Warning">

- If all servers in the specified geofencing region are unavailable, the SDK will directly report an error.
- Since there is cross-regional public internet between the specified geofencing region and the App user's region, poor public internet network quality will affect the audio and video experience.
</Warning>

Currently, the SDK supports the following regions:

<Note title="Notes">

If you need to support more regions, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support.
</Note>


|Region|Enum|
|-|-|
|Mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan|CN|
|North America|NA|
|India|IN|
|Europe|EU|
|Asia, excluding Mainland China and India|AS|

## Prerequisites

Before using the geofencing feature, please ensure:
- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated the ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio and video streaming functionality. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Implementation Process

### Open geofencing permission

Geofencing capability may require payment in some cases. Please contact ZEGO business to confirm and open geofencing permission.


### Set geofencing

- Geofencing information: Includes geofencing type and geofencing region list.
- Geofencing type: Includes two types: Include and Exclude. The geofencing type will act on the geofencing region list.
    - Include: Indicates that all regions in the region list are included in the geofence.
    - Exclude: Indicates that all regions in the region list are excluded from the geofence.

Before creating the SDK, call the [setGeoFence](@setGeoFence) interface to set geofencing information.

<Warning title="Warning">


Please configure geofencing information before calling [createEngine](@createEngine), otherwise it will be invalid.
</Warning>


```java
// Example of setting Include mode
ZegoGeoFenceType geofence_type = ZegoGeoFenceType.INCLUDE;//Set Include mode
List<Integer> geofence_area_list = new ArrayList<>(); // Set region list information, set at least 1, maximum set not greater than the number supported by the SDK
geofence_area_list.add(2);// ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.CN
geofence_area_list.add(3);// ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.NA
ZegoExpressEngine.setGeoFence(geofence_type, geofence_area_list);// This interface is a static method, called before createEngine

// Example of setting Exclude mode
ZegoGeoFenceType geofence_type = ZegoGeoFenceType.EXCLUDE;//Set Exclude mode
List<Integer> geofence_area_list = new ArrayList<>();// Set region list information, set at least 1, maximum set not greater than or equal to the number supported by the SDK
geofence_area_list.add(2);// ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.CN
geofence_area_list.add(3);// ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.NA
ZegoExpressEngine.setGeoFence(geofence_type, geofence_area_list);// This interface is a static method, called before createEngine
```

### Integrate other features

After completing the geofencing settings, you can proceed with other feature integration.
