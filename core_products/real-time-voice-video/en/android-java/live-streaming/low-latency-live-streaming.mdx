---

## Feature Overview


ZEGO [Low-Latency Live Streaming](/live-streaming-ios/introduction/overview) (L3) is created for high-quality experience, creating an ultimate live streaming experience with ultra-low latency, super-strong synchronization, extreme weak network resistance, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and instant first frame, making it the "hexagon warrior" among live streaming distribution products.

Compared with traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO Low-Latency Live Streaming is based on full-link self-developed private protocols, massive ordered data networks (MSDN), and end-to-end monitoring, providing more stable and higher quality live streaming distribution services, helping the business side solve "live streaming experience" pain points, and is the common choice of many leading live streaming customers.

### Feature Highlights

Low-Latency Live Streaming supports tens of millions of ultra-large concurrency, providing stable and high-quality live streaming distribution services with the following 6 high-quality features:

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Highlight</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-Low Latency</td>
<td>Live streaming latency of 600 ms to 1000 ms under normal network conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Super-Strong Synchronization
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level synchronization, synchronization error between different audiences < 400ms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extreme Weak Network Resistance</td>
<td>Supports extreme weak network resistance, up to 80% packet loss without disconnection, and can still play stably in complex network environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-Low Stuttering</td>
<td>Compared with CDN live streaming, using ZEGO Low-Latency Live Streaming can reduce the stuttering rate by up to 75% or more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra-Clear Picture Quality</td>
<td>Provides rich picture quality optimization capabilities through the All-in-one SDK, implementing user-level high-quality picture quality practices in various scenarios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Overseas Live Streaming
</td>
<td>
Break through pain points such as high stuttering, slow first frame, and poor picture quality one by one, improving the live streaming experience of global audiences, and global users can enjoy live streaming social networking.
Break through bottlenecks such as poor overseas network environment, high proportion of mid-to-low-end devices, and poor broadcasting environment of amateur hosts, assisting enterprises in overseas localization.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show Live Streaming</td>
<td>Provides essential show live streaming features such as instant opening and beauty effects, supporting seamless switching solutions for multi-scenarios such as cross-room PK and live streaming to 1V1.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Education Large Classes
</td>
<td>Ultra-low latency online classrooms perfectly compatible with diverse teaching plugins, providing excellent teacher-student interaction experience, making students' progress consistent with teachers in the classroom, and teaching immersion comparable to offline classrooms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Game Live Streaming</td>
<td>In high bitrate game scenarios, it can adaptively transcode according to audience bandwidth, effectively reducing the stuttering rate, so that all audiences can watch game interactions smoothly. Based on HD low bitrate, it effectively improves game picture quality at the same bitrate, not limited by audience network bottlenecks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Event Live Streaming
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level latency and ultra-low stuttering, say goodbye to spoilers, grasp赛场 dynamics in real time, and don't miss any highlights. Supports 4K 60fps and HDR, presenting rich赛场 details and silky ultra-clear dynamic pictures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E-commerce Live Streaming</td>
<td>Matches the strong real-time requirements of selling with goods, hosts respond to audience shopping inquiries at extreme speed, improving stickiness between hosts and audiences.
Achieve strong synchronization and fairness for activities such as auctions, panic buying, and flash sales, stimulating user order conversion in the live room.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Watch Together</td>
<td>Global massive audiences can watch movies, concerts, or competitive competitions synchronously in the same live room. Low-latency, multi-terminal synchronized audio and video experience helps users communicate freely at zero distance, bringing an immersive viewing experience.</td>
</tr>

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the low-latency live streaming feature, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated the ZEGO Express SDK in your project and implemented basic audio and video streaming functionality. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Usage Steps

Set the "resourceMode" parameter of [ZegoPlayerConfig](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-entity-zego-player-config#resource-mode) to "ONLY_L3", and call the [startPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~Java_android~class~im-zego-zegoexpress-zego-express-engine&jumpType=route#start-playing-stream-1) interface to play the low-latency live stream pushed remotely based on the passed stream ID parameter "streamID".

```java
ZegoPlayerConfig playerConfig = new ZegoPlayerConfig();
playerConfig.resourceMode = ZegoStreamResourceMode.ONLY_L3;
ZegoExpressEngine.getEngine().startPlayingStream(streamID, playCanvas, playerConfig);
```
