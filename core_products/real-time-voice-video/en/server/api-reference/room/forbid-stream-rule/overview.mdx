# Overview

When developers need to manage users' speaking permissions in specific rooms directly from their business backend, they can use ZEGOCLOUD's Stream Banning Rule server APIs to specify permissions for a user's Stream ID in the corresponding room. This allows directly banning the corresponding audio or video, enabling scenarios such as live stream hosts muting rule-violating users in the room.

Developers can also query existing banning rules and delete expired or inapplicable banning rules to better maintain business order, protect user rights, and improve product experience.

<Warning title="Note">
To use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable the relevant permissions.
