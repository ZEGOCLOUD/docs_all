# Overview

ZEGOCLOUD server provides a set of User Banning Rule APIs. When developers need to directly manage user permissions such as login and stream publishing from their business backend, they can set relevant banning rules (e.g., based on user's IP address, UserID, etc.) to directly ban the corresponding users. This enables features such as preventing rule-violating users from logging in to specific rooms, or preventing them from unmuted after joining a room.

Developers can also query existing banning rules and delete expired or inapplicable banning rules to better maintain business order, protect user rights, and improve product experience.

<Warning title="Note">
To use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable the relevant permissions.
