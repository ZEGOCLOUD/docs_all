      summary: AddStream
      description: |
        Use this interface to add a stream to a specified Room. This is commonly used in "watch together" scenarios, such as adding a CDN live stream to a specified Room, allowing users in the Room to obtain the stream ID and enabling server-side control over the live content in the specified Room.

        <Warning title="Note">
        - When adding a stream to a specified Room, ensure that the Room exists. This interface cannot create a Room. If you want to automatically create the corresponding Room when adding a stream, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to enable the related feature.
        - This interface is generally used together with [Delete Room Stream](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/delete-stream), for example, when the business needs to stop broadcasting a stream to a Room.
        </Warning>

        This interface is only used to trigger notifications related to stream addition in the Room and does not perform actual stream publishing operations. Developers need to call the `startPublishingStream` interface from their client (or other stream publishing methods) to publish the stream, so that the added stream can be played by the `startPlayingStream` interface.

        Clients receive notifications of stream addition in the Room using ZEGO Express SDK callback interfaces:

        | |ZegoExpress SDK|LiveRoom SDK|
        |-|-|-|
        |iOS/macOS| onRoomStreamUpdate | onStreamUpdated |
        |Android| onRoomStreamUpdate | onStreamUpdated |
        |Windows| onRoomStreamUpdate |  OnStreamUpdated |
        |Web| roomStreamUpdate | onStreamUpdated |

        <Note title="Call Rate Limit">All Rooms under the same AppID: 10 times/second (test environment: 1 time/second)</Note>
        <Warning title="Warning">
        - It is not recommended to use the same UserId as actual users in the Room to avoid conflicts with the client SDK's stream addition behavior. You can use a specific name to identify server-side behavior, for example: userId = "Server-Administrator".
        - If you use the same UserId as actual users in the Room (not recommended), please note the following:
          - The client with the corresponding operator's UserId will not receive the stream addition callback triggered by this server-side interface.
          - If the actual user's UserId in the Room has not published the stream, the stream deletion logic for the corresponding StreamId will be triggered.
          - If the actual user's UserId in the Room leaves the Room, the stream deletion logic for the corresponding StreamId will be triggered.
        </Warning>
