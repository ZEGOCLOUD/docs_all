# Debug using Postman

- - -

<Warning title="Warning">

This document is no longer updated. It is recommended to use [How to Debug Server API Online](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/call-api-online) for debugging.

</Warning>

This document describes how to use Postman to debug server APIs.

Postman is an API Debugging tool that allows developers to conveniently and intuitively debug server APIs in a graphical interface.

To facilitate developers in debugging cloud communication product server APIs, ZEGO provides a corresponding Postman Collection with predefined request parameters for each interface. Developers only need to modify the parameter values after importing.

## Prerequisites

- Have downloaded and installed [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Have downloaded and extracted the [Collection for Cloud Communication Product Server API](https://artifact-sdk.zego.im/media/files/RTC_postman_collection.zip).
- Have logged in to the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.zego.im/">ZEGO Console</a> to obtain the AppId and ServerSecret required for calling the interface.

<Warning title="Warning">


- Postman client interfaces vary slightly across different platforms. This document uses Postman on macOS as an example.
- The Collection provided in this document is for debugging only and does not include all server APIs.

</Warning>



## Import and configure Collection

1. Click "Import" to import both files obtained from extracting the collection together.

2. Set the environment to "RTC".

3. Open the "RTC" environment, set the AppId and ServerSecret obtained in the [Prerequisites](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/debug-via-postman) to the corresponding "CURRENT VALUE" of the environment variables, and then save.

<Note title="Note">


If the AppId is for a test environment (see the parameter description for IsTest in "Common Parameters" under <a target="_blank" href="./accessing-server-apis.mdx#公共请求参数">Calling Method</a> for details), you also need to modify the value of "IsTest" in the environment variables (the last parameter in the figure above) to "true".


</Note>




## Debug interfaces

This section uses 3 interfaces as examples to introduce how to use Postman to debug server APIs.

<Note title="Note">


The ZEGO-provided collection implements automatic filling of common parameters through environment variables and pre-scripts. The pre-scripts can be viewed at the location shown in the figure below. Developers can refer to them when developing the server.

### Send broadcast message

This API is used to send broadcast messages in a Room. Before calling this interface, developers need to log in to the Room first.

<Note title="Note">


Developers can refer to [Run Sample Source Code](/real-time-video-android-java/client-sdk/download-demo) to run the Demo to log in to the Room, or refer to [Quick Start](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/integrating-sdk) to develop their own application to log in to the Room.


</Note>



1. Select "SendBroadcastMessage" in Collections, and modify the parameter values in Param according to the parameter description in [Send broadcast message](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/send-broadcast-message). Parameter values wrapped in double braces are environment variables and do not need to be manually modified.

2. Click "Send" and view the response content below. If the Error code in the response message is not 0, please modify the request according to the error description in the response message and send again.

### Kick User out of Room

This API is used to kick a specified User out of the Room. All current Publish stream and Play stream of that User will be stopped. Before calling this interface, developers need to log in to the Room first.

<Note title="Note">


Developers can refer to [Run Sample Source Code](/real-time-video-android-java/client-sdk/download-demo) to run the Demo to log in to the Room, or refer to [Quick Start](/real-time-video-android-java/quick-start/integrating-sdk) to develop their own application to log in to the Room.


</Note>



1. Select "KickoutUser" in Collections, and modify the parameter values in Param according to the parameter description in [Kick User out of Room](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/kick-out-user). UserId[] is the User ID to be kicked out of the Room. You can carry one or more, supporting up to 5 User IDs. For specific meanings, please refer to the parameter description.

### Start Stream Mixing

This API is used to start/update Stream Mixing tasks.

<Warning title="Warning">


Before using this interface for the first time, you need to contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable it.




1. Select "StartMix" in Collections, and modify the parameter values in Body according to the parameter description in [Start Stream Mixing](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/stream-mixing/start-mix).

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://doc-media.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/server_v2/postman/start_mix.png" /></Frame>

2. Click "Send" and view the response content below. If the Error code in the response message is not 0, please modify the request according to the error description in the response message and send again.
