# Single Stream Transcoding Stopped Callback

- - -

## Description

When developers need to understand the single stream transcoding tasks of the current App, they can refer to [Callback Configuration Description](/real-time-video-server/callback/receiving-callback) to configure related callback interfaces. After initiating a [Stop Single Stream Transcoding](/real-time-video-server/api-reference/stream-mixing/stop-cloud-transcode) request, they can view the result of stopping the transcoding task through this callback.

## Callback instructions

- Request method: POST.

<Note title="Note">


  The callback data format is JSON. You need to perform UrlDecode decoding on it.

</Note>



- Request URL: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to configure the callback URL.
- Transfer protocol: HTTPS/HTTP. HTTPS is recommended.

| Appid | String | Unique identifier of the App. |
| Timestamp | String | Server current time, Unix timestamp. |

## Data example

```json
{
    "Event": "transcode_stop",
    "Appid": "111111",
    "Timestamp": "timestamp",
    "Nonce": "nonce",
    "Signature": "signature",
    "TaskId": "2222",
    "UserId": "2222",
    "Sequence": 0,
    "Status": "TranscodeStarted",
    "StopReason": 0
}
```

## Return response

Return HTTP status code 2XX (e.g., 200) indicates success, and other responses indicate failure.


## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGO server does not receive a response, or the received HTTP status code is not 2XX (e.g., 200), it will attempt to retry, **up to 5 retries**. The interval between each retry request and the **previous request** is 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the 5th retry still fails, no more retries will be made, and the callback will be lost.
