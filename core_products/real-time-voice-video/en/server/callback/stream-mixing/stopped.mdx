# Stream Mixing Stopped Callback

---

## Description

When developers need to know the stream mixing status of the current App, they can first [configure callbacks](/real-time-video-server/callback/receiving-callback). When there is a stream mixing stopped on the stream mixing server of the App, a POST request will be made to the callback URL.

<Warning title="Attention">


When the following situations occur:
- When the stream mixing stop request processing fails, there is no callback.
- When the stream mixing process is abnormally terminated, there is no callback.

</Warning>





## Callback instructions

- Request method: POST.

<Note title="Note">


  The callback data format is JSON. You need to perform UrlDecode decoding on it.

</Note>



- Request URL: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to configure the callback URL.
- Transfer protocol: HTTPS/HTTP. HTTPS is recommended.

It is recommended that you convert some parameters to Int for logical processing. Related fields include `appid`, `seq`, and `timestamp`.

## Data example

```json
{
    "appid": "111111",
    "channel_id": "2222",
    "event": "mix_stop",
    "mix_stream_alias": "aaa",
    "mix_url": "rtmp://rtmp.wsdemo.zego.im/zegodemo/aaa",
    "nonce": "7257787020413449571",
    "publish_id": "abc",
    "seq": "1234",
    "signature": "fadc2c4abb5714c30a711b3ad6f7783e37531263",
    "task_id": "111111:1111",
    "timestamp": "1689835223"
}
```

## Return response


Return HTTP status code 2XX (e.g., 200) indicates success, and other responses indicate failure.


## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGO server does not receive a response, or the received HTTP status code is not 2XX (e.g., 200), it will attempt to retry, **up to 5 retries**. The interval between each retry request and the **previous request** is 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the 5th retry still fails, no more retries will be made, and the callback will be lost.
