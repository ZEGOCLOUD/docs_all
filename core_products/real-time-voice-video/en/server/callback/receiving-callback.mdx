# Callback Configuration Description
---

When using ZEGOCLOUD server API, developers can connect to the business backend through Callback services to further ensure the orderly and normal operation of the business.

<Warning title="Warning">


**Callback services cannot guarantee complete reliability. Please carefully consider the risks of using Callback solutions to build core business processes.**

</Warning>



## Usage scenarios

For example:

- After the client successfully Publishes a stream, the business backend can receive the [Stream created Callback](/real-time-video-server/callback/stream/created) from the ZEGOCLOUD server to add to the live broadcast list (maintainable live broadcast list).

<Note title="Note">


1. The "pic_url" in the Stream created Callback can be used for moderation. The default is a cached image every 20s.
2. "pic_url" can only be used during the Publish stream process and becomes invalid after the Publish stream ends.


</Note>



- After the client stops Publishing a stream, the business backend can receive the [Stream destroyed Callback](/real-time-video-server/callback/stream/destroyed) from the ZEGOCLOUD server to delete from the live broadcast list (maintainable live broadcast list).

- After the client ends the live broadcast, the business backend can receive the [Recording file generated Callback](/real-time-video-server/callback/cdn/cdn-record-completed) from the ZEGOCLOUD server to implement on-demand services.


## Callback configuration

Developers can configure Callback information in the [ZEGO Console ](https://console.zego.im) under "Project Configuration > Server Callback Configuration" according to actual business needs.


At the same time, you can configure the URL address to receive ZEGO callbacks as needed.

<Note title="Note">


You can view the console interface as follows:

- Users who registered for the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) after **2021-11-16**, please refer to [Console - Server Callback Configuration](/console/server-callback-configuration).
- Users who registered for the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) on or before **2021-11-16**, please refer to "Advanced Configuration" in [Console (Old Version) - Project Management](/console-old/project-management#高级配置).




## Callback description

- Request method: POST.

<Note title="Note">


  The Callback data format is JSON. You need to perform UrlDecode decoding on it.




- Transfer protocol: HTTPS/HTTP. HTTPS is recommended.

## Return response

Return HTTP status code 2XX (e.g., 200) indicates success, and other responses indicate failure.

## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGO server does not receive a response, or the received HTTP status code is not 2XX (e.g., 200), it will attempt to retry, **up to 5 retries**. The interval between each retry request and the **last request** is 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the 5th retry still fails, no more retries will be made, and the Callback will be lost.
