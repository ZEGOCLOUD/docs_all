<td>
<p>Reason for Room destruction.</p>
<ul>
<li>0: Normal destruction.</li>
<li>1: The last User in the Room had a heartbeat timeout, and the Room was empty, so it was destroyed.</li>
<li>2: The last User in the Room went offline, and the Room was empty, so it was destroyed.</li>
<li>3: The last User in the Room was <a href="/real-time-video-server/api-reference/room/kick-out-user">Kicked out</a>, and the Room was empty, so it was destroyed.</li>

## Data example

```json
{
    "event": "room_close",
    "appid": 1,
    "timestamp": 1499676989,
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",
    "room_id": "rid_1242649",
    "room_session_id": 858012925204410400,
    "close_reason": 1,
    "room_close_time": "1499676989909"
}
```

## Return response

Return HTTP status code 2XX (e.g., 200) indicates success, and other responses indicate failure.


## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGO server does not receive a response, or the received HTTP status code is not 2XX (e.g., 200), it will attempt to retry, **up to 5 retries**. The interval between each retry request and the **last request** is 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the 5th retry still fails, no more retries will be made, and the Callback will be lost.
