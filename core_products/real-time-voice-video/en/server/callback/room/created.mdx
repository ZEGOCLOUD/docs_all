## Data example

```json
{
    "event": "room_create",
    "appid": 1,
    "timestamp": 1499676978,
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",
    "room_id": "rid_1242649",
    "room_session_id": 858012925204410400,
    "room_create_time": "1499676978027",
    "id_name": "id123"
}
```

## Return response

Returning HTTP status code 2XX (e.g. 200) indicates success, other responses indicate failure.


## Callback retry strategy

If ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the received HTTP status code is not 2XX (e.g. 200), it will try to retry, **up to 5 retries**. The interval between each retry request and the **previous request** is 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s respectively. If the 5th retry still fails, no more retries will be made and the callback will be lost.
