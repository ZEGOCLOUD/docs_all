This feature can be used to analyze network conditions on the link, or to understand the network status of local and remote users.


4. Added network speed testing feature

    This feature supports uplink/downlink network speed testing, which can be used to detect whether the network environment is suitable for publishing/playing streams with specified bitrates. Call the `startNetworkSpeedTest` interface to enable this feature, configure `ZegoNetworkSpeedTestConfig` parameters to control the speed test process, and the speed test results will be notified through the `onNetworkSpeedTestQualityUpdate` callback.
