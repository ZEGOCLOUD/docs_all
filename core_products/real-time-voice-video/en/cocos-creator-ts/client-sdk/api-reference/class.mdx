| callback | [ZegoUploadLogResultCallback](#zegouploadlogresultcallback) | Log upload result callback. |

**Details**

By default, SDK creates and prints log files in the App's default directory. Each log file defaults to a maximum of 5MB. Three log files are written over and over in a circular fashion. When calling this function, SDK will auto package and upload the log files to the ZEGO server.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: Developers can provide a business 窶彷eedback窶 channel in the App. When users feedback problems, they can call this function to upload the local log information of SDK to help locate user problems.
- **When to call**: After [createEngine].
- **Caution**: 1.After calling this interface to upload logs, if you call [destroyEngine] or exit the App too quickly, there may be a failure.It is recommended to wait a few seconds, and then call [destroyEngine] or exit the App after receiving the upload success callback. 2.If you want to call before [createEngine], use the [submitLog] interface.

Required: No. Default value: null.Caution: If the connection is retried multiple times due to network problems, the retry status will not be thrown by this callback. |

**Details**

If the room does not exist, [loginRoom] creates and logs in the room. SDK uses the 'room' to organize users. After users log in to a room, they can use interface such as push stream [startPublishingStream], pull stream [startPlayingStream], send and receive broadcast messages [sendBroadcastMessage], etc. To prevent the app from being impersonated by a malicious user, you can add authentication before logging in to the room, that is, the [token] parameter in the ZegoRoomConfig object passed in by the [config] parameter.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: In the same room, users can conduct live broadcast, audio and video calls, etc.
- **When to call /Trigger**: This interface is called after [createEngine] initializes the SDK.
- **Caution**:   1. Apps that use different appIDs cannot intercommunication with each other.
  2. SDK supports startPlayingStream audio and video streams from different rooms under the same appID, that is, startPlayingStream audio and video streams across rooms. Since ZegoExpressEngine's room related callback notifications are based on the same room, when developers want to startPlayingStream streams across rooms, developers need to maintain related messages and signaling notifications by themselves.
  3. It is strongly recommended that userID corresponds to the user ID of the business APP, that is, a userID and a real user are fixed and unique, and should not be passed to the SDK in a random userID. Because the unique and fixed userID allows ZEGO technicians to quickly locate online problems.
  4. After the first login failure due to network reasons or the room is disconnected, the default time of SDK reconnection is 20min.
- **Privacy reminder**: Please do not fill in sensitive user information in this interface, including but not limited to mobile phone number, ID number, passport number, real name, etc.
- **Related callbacks**:   1. When the user starts to log in to the room, the room is successfully logged in, or the room fails to log in, the [onRoomStateChanged] (Not supported before 2.18.0, please use [onRoomStateUpdate]) callback will be triggered to notify the developer of the status of the current user connected to the room.
  2. Different users who log in to the same room can get room related notifications in the same room (eg [onRoomUserUpdate], [onRoomStreamUpdate], etc.), and users in one room cannot receive room signaling notifications in another room.
  3. If the network is temporarily interrupted due to network quality reasons, the SDK will automatically reconnect internally. You can get the current connection status of the local room by listening to the [onRoomStateChanged] (Not supported before 2.18.0, please use [onRoomStateUpdate]) callback method, and other users in the same room will receive [onRoomUserUpdate] callback notification.
  4. Messages sent in one room (e.g. [setStreamExtraInfo], [sendBroadcastMessage], [sendBarrageMessage], [sendCustomCommand], etc.) cannot be received callback ((eg [onRoomStreamExtraInfoUpdate], [onIMRecvBroadcastMessage], [onIMRecvBarrageMessage], [onIMRecvCustomCommand], etc) in other rooms. Currently, SDK does not provide the ability to send messages across rooms. Developers can integrate the SDK of third-party IM to achieve.
- **Related APIs**:   1. Users can call [logoutRoom] to log out. In the case that a user has successfully logged in and has not logged out, if the login interface is called again, the console will report an error and print the error code 1002001.
  2. SDK supports multi-room login, please call [setRoomMode] function to select multi-room mode before engine initialization, and then call [loginRoom] to log in to multi-room.
  3. Calling [destroyEngine] will also automatically log out.

- **Use cases**: Generally, in the case of a poor network environment, adjusting and increasing the playback buffer of the pull stream will significantly reduce the audio and video freezes, but will increase the delay.
- **When to call**: after called [createEngine], if it has been set, you need to reset it every time you play the stream again.
- **Caution**: When the upper limit of the cache interval set by the developer exceeds 4000ms, the value will be 4000ms. When the upper limit of the cache interval set by the developer is less than the lower limit of the cache interval, the upper limit will be automatically set as the lower limit.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: This interface can be used when developers need to prioritize the quality of a audio and video stream in businessｼdo not use in pure audio caseｼ. For example: in class scene, if students pull multiple streams, you can set high priority for teacher stream.
- **When to call**: after called [startPlayingStream].
- **Caution**: By default, all streams have the same weight. Only one stream can be set with high priority, whichever is set last. After the flow is stopped, the initial state is automatically restored, and all flows have the same weight.When the local network is not good, while ensuring the focus flow, other stalls may be caused more.

**Details**

In the process of real-time audio and video interaction, local users can use this function to control whether to receive audio data from designated remote users when pulling streams as needed. When the developer does not receive the audio receipt, the hardware and network overhead can be reduced.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: Call this function when developers need to quickly close and restore remote audio. Compared to re-flow, it can greatly reduce the time and improve the interactive experience.
- **When to call**: This function can be called after calling [createEngine].
- **Caution**: 
 1. When used together with [muteAllPlayAudioStreams], they can override each other's configurations. 
 2. When used together with [muteAllPlayStreamAudio], this function only works when the [muteAllPlayStreamAudio] function is set to `false`. 
 3. After stopping streaming, any properties previously set for this stream such as [setPlayVolume], [mutePlayStreamAudio], [mutePlayStreamVideo] and other streaming-related configurations will become invalid and need to be reset before the next stream is pulled.
- **Related APIs**: You can call the [muteAllPlayStreamAudio] function to control whether to receive all audio data. When the two functions [muteAllPlayStreamAudio] and [mutePlayStreamAudio] are set to `false` at the same time, the local user can receive the audio data of the remote user when the stream is pulled: 1. When the [muteAllPlayStreamAudio(true)] function is called, it is globally effective, that is, local users will be prohibited from receiving all remote users' audio data. At this time, the [mutePlayStreamAudio] function will not take effect whether it is called before or after [muteAllPlayStreamAudio].2. When the [muteAllPlayStreamAudio(false)] function is called, the local user can receive the audio data of all remote users. At this time, the [mutePlayStreamAudio] function can be used to control whether to receive a single audio data. Calling the [mutePlayStreamAudio(true, streamID)] function allows the local user to receive audio data other than the `streamID`; calling the [mutePlayStreamAudio(false, streamID)] function allows the local user to receive all audio data.

| enable | boolean | Whether to enable the audio capture device, `true`: enable audio capture device, `false`: disable audio capture device. |

**Details**

This function is used to control whether to use the audio collection device. When the audio collection device is turned off, the SDK will no longer occupy the audio device. Of course, if the stream is being published at this time, by default, mute data will be used as audio data for streaming. not support Linux.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: When the user never needs to use the audio, you can call this function to close the audio collection.
- **Default value**: The default is `true`.
- **When to call**: After creating the engine [createEngine].
- **Related APIs**: Turning off or turning on the microphone on the hardware is a time-consuming operation, and there is a certain performance overhead when the user performs frequent operations. [muteMicrophone] is generally recommended.

**Details**

After enabling, the SDK matches the capture frame rate range supported by the camera according to the set frame rate range, and dynamically adjusts the capture frame rate of the camera according to the ambient brightness within this range to improve the screen brightness when the set frame rate is too high.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: The frame rate set by the user on the streaming end is too high, and the ambient lighting is low, so the subject cannot be displayed or recognized normally. For example, live broadcast scenes with high exposure requirements.
- **When to call**: After creating the engine [createEngine], before the camera starts.
- **Caution**: Takes When calling [setVideoConfig] to set the frame rate lower than the expected minimum frame rate, the frame rate value set by [setVideoConfig] will be used. Due to the different hardware and algorithm strategies of different mobile phone manufacturers, the effect of this interface is different on different models or on the front and rear cameras of the same model.
- **Related APIs**: Through [setVideoConfig], you can set the camera capture frame rate and the encoder encoding frame rate.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| enable | boolean | Whether to enable echo cancellation, true: enable, false: disable |

**Details**

Turning on echo cancellation, the SDK filters the collected audio data to reduce the echo component in the audio.
 Use case: When you need to reduce the echo to improve the call quality and user experience, you can turn on this feature.

<Note title="">
- **When to call**: It needs to be called after [createEngine].
- **Caution**: The AEC function only supports the processing of sounds playbacked through the SDK, such as sounds played by the playing stream, media player, audio effect player, etc. Before this function is called, the SDK automatically determines whether to use AEC. Once this function is called, the SDK does not automatically determine whether to use AEC.
- **Related APIs**: Developers can use [enableHeadphoneAEC] to set whether to enable AEC when using headphones, and use [setAECMode] to set the echo cancellation mode.

**Details**

When [enableAEC] is used to turn on echo cancellation, it is only turned on when the speaker is used for mobile terminal equipment. Call this function if you need to turn echo cancellation on or off when using the headset.
 Use case: It is common when the mobile device is connected to a external sound card as the audio output source. In order to eliminate the echo in this case, you need to call this function to turn on the echo cancellation.

<Note title="">
- **Default value**: Android is off by default and iOS is on by default.
- **When to call**: It needs to be called after [createEngine], before [startPublishingStream], [startPlayingStream], [startPreview], [createMediaPlayer], [createAudioEffectPlayer] and [createRealTimeSequentialDataManager].
- **Caution**: Turning on echo cancellation will increase the ear return delay. On the iOS platform, the SDK cannot distinguish between the headset and the external sound card. If you use this function to turn off the system echo cancellation when using the headset, the sound played by the external sound card will be collected when the user accesses the external sound card.
- **Related APIs**: When the headset is not used, you can set whether the SDK turns on echo cancellation through [enableAEC].
- **Platform differences**: Only supports iOS and Android.
