# Example Code Running Guide


## Prepare environment

Please ensure the development environment meets the following technical requirements:

* Windows: Windows 7 or above.
* macOS: macOS 11.0 or above.
* Linux: Linux operating systems supporting x86_64, aarch64, armhf architectures. If you need to use the Linux platform, please contact ZEGO Technical Support.
* Audio and video peripherals such as microphones and cameras, ensure the computer is properly connected to the Internet.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, it is recommended to use the Long Term Support version displayed on the official website homepage.

## Prerequisites

You have created a project in the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to "Project Information" in [Console - Project Management](/console/project-info).

<Warning title="Note">
The SDK also supports Token authentication. If you need to upgrade the authentication method, please refer to [How to upgrade from AppSign authentication to Token authentication](/console/project-info).
</Warning>

Local Download
</Card>

## Run example code

1. Use Visual Studio Code to open the example source code.

2. In the "/keycenter.js" file, fill in the "AppID" and "AppSign" required for SDK initialization.

<Warning title="Note">


    Please use the AppID and AppSign obtained in the [Prerequisites](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/run-example-code) of this article to fill in correctly, otherwise the example source code cannot run normally.

</Warning>

3. Install dependencies and start

<Warning title="Note">


    When executing `npm install` to install the SDK, if the download from the npm official mirror is slow, you can switch to a domestic mirror: `npm set registry http://registry.npmmirror.com`.

</Warning>



    ```bash
    $ npm install
    $ npm run start
    ```


## Experience Video Call features

Run the project on a real device. After running successfully, you can see the local video.

For convenience, ZEGO provides a [Web Debug Example](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html). On this page, enter the same AppID and RoomID, enter different UserIDs and corresponding [Token](/console/development-assistance/temporary-token), you can join the same room and communicate with the real device. When the audio/video call starts successfully, you can hear the remote audio and see the remote video.
