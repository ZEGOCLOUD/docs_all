# Differences between Video Call SDK and Audio Call SDK

- - -

Starting from version v2.20.0, there are no longer API differences between Video Call and Audio Call. You can switch from Video Call SDK to Audio Call SDK at any time, and vice versa.

The difference between Audio Call SDK and Video Call SDK is only functional: for Audio Call SDK, some video-related APIs (such as video encoding parameter settings, ZegoCanvas parameters for preview and playing stream, etc.) have no effect after being set, but will not cause errors.

The involved APIs are as follows:

- [startPreview](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_electron~class~ZegoExpressEngine#start-preview)
    - In Video Call SDK: Starts the microphone and camera, and if a view is passed in the canvas parameter, the SDK will render the preview in that view.
    - In Audio Call SDK: Starts the microphone. Developers can set the canvas parameter to null when calling this API, or if there is an overload function, use the overload function of this API without the canvas parameter.

<Warning title="Note">



When calling `startPreview` on the Audio Call Flutter / Electron / uni-app / Unity3D / React-Native SDK, the camera will still be started; developers can call `enableCamera` to turn off the camera before calling `startPreview` to avoid the SDK requesting camera permissions.

</Warning>




- [startPlayingStream](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_electron~class~ZegoExpressEngine#start-playing-stream)
    - In Video Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the streamed stream, and if the developer passes a view in the canvas parameter, the SDK will render the video of the streamed stream in that view.
    - In Audio Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the streamed stream. Developers can set the canvas parameter to null when calling this API, or if there is an overload function, use the overload function of this API without the canvas parameter.

<Warning title="Note">



All other video-related APIs have no effect in Audio Call SDK. You can determine whether an API is video-related by the comment provided in the API `Note: This function is only available in ZegoExpressVideo SDK!`. If this comment exists, it means the API is video-related.

</Warning>
