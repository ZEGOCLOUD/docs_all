# Geofencing

- - -

## Feature overview

Geofencing refers to limiting the transmission of audio, video and signaling data to a certain region to comply with regional data privacy and security regulations, that is, limiting access to audio and video services in a specific region. For example, when the specified geofencing region is Europe, regardless of the region where the App user is located, the region actually accessed by the SDK will be Europe.

<Warning title="Note">

- If all servers in the specified geofencing region are unavailable, the SDK will directly report an error.
- Since there is a cross-regional public Internet between the specified geofencing region and the App user region, poor public Internet network quality will affect the audio and video experience.

## Prerequisites

Before using the geofencing feature, please ensure:
- You have created a project in the [ZEGO Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic audio and video publishing and playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Implementation process

### Enable geofencing permission

Geofencing capability may require payment in some cases. Please contact ZEGO Business to confirm and enable geofencing permission.


### Set geofencing

- Geofencing information: Includes geofencing type and geofencing region list.
- Geofencing type: Includes two types: Include and Exclude. The geofencing type will act on the geofencing region list.
    - Include: Indicates that all regions in the region list are included within the geofencing.
    - Exclude: Indicates that all regions in the region list are excluded from the geofencing.

Before creating the SDK, call the [setGeoFence](@setGeoFence) interface to set geofencing information.

<Warning title="Note">


Please configure geofencing information before calling [createEngine](@createEngine), otherwise it will be invalid.

</Warning>




```javascript
// Example of setting Include mode
const geofence_type = zgDefines.ZegoGeoFenceType.Include;//Set Include mode
// Set region list information, at least 1 must be set, at most not greater than the number supported by the SDK
let geofence_area_list= [2, 3]  // 2-ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.CN  3-ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.NA
zgEngine.setGeoFence(geofence_type, geofence_area_list)  //Call before createEngine

// Example of setting Exclude mode
const geofence_type = zgDefines.ZegoGeoFenceType.Exclude;//Set Exclude mode
// Set region list information, at least 1 must be set, at most not greater than the number supported by the SDK
let geofence_area_list= [2, 3]  //2-ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.CN  3-ZegoGeoFenceAreaCode.NA
zgEngine.setGeoFence(geofence_type, geofence_area_list)  //Call before createEngine
```

### Integrate other features

After completing the geofencing settings, you can proceed with other feature integration.
