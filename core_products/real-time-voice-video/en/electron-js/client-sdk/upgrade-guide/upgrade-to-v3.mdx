# Upgrade guide for version 3.0.0 and above

- - -

<Warning title="Note">
- If your current SDK is lower than version 3.0.0 and you need to upgrade to any SDK version 3.0.0 or above, please be sure to read this article.
- In addition, it is recommended that you check your business-related interfaces based on the **current version number** and **target upgrade version number**, referring to the change notes between the two versions in the [Release Notes](/real-time-video-electron-js/client-sdk/release-notes).
</Warning>

This article will introduce the instructions and precautions for upgrading the Express Electron SDK to version 3.0.0 and above.

## Deprecation instructions

1. Deprecated the `General`, `Communication`, and `Live` scenarios in the [ZegoScenario](@-ZegoScenario) scenario enumeration. Please refer to the [Scenario-based Audio and Video Configuration](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/scenario-based-audio-video-configuration) document for adaptation.


## Deletion instructions

The following interfaces that were deprecated in previous versions have been deleted.

Method name | Description |
--- | --- |
setDebugVerbose | Sets the debug verbose switch and language. This function was deprecated in version 2.3.0. Please use [enableDebugAssistant](@enableDebugAssistant) to implement the original functionality.
loginMultiRoom | Login to multiple rooms. This method was deprecated after version 2.9.0. If you need to implement multi-room functionality, please call the [setRoomMode](@setRoomMode) function to set multi-room mode before engine initialization, then use [loginRoom](@loginRoom) to login to multiple rooms. If you call the [loginRoom](@loginRoom) function to login to multiple rooms, please ensure that the same user information is passed in.
setPlayStreamVideoLayer | Sets the selection of playing stream video layer. This function was deprecated after version 2.3.0. Please use [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType) instead.
onDeviceError | Device exception notification. This function was deprecated in version 2.15.0 and above. Please use [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback) instead.
