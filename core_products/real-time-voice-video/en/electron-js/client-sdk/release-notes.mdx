    Supports filling silent frames for audio and video streams relayed to CDN, which can be used to avoid stuttering or audio-video desynchronization caused by timestamp misalignment.

3. Media player supports caching network resources locally

    Supports caching network resources locally. If the same network resource needs to be played, cached data will be used preferentially, improving user experience.

    For related APIs, please refer to [enableLocalCache](@enableLocalCache), [onMediaPlayerLocalCache](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback)

4. All network requests support IPv6 protocol

5. Support for hardware decoding acceleration for MJPEG format

    Note: This feature only supports pre-processing for screenshots, not other processing (such as rotation, watermarks, etc.).

    When the video format output by the capture device is MJPEG, hardware decoding acceleration is enabled by default to prevent issues such as insufficient frame rate caused by insufficient device performance.

    This feature is mainly suitable for use with capture devices at 4K resolution.

6. Media player supports callback for video resolution change events

    The media player supports throwing relevant callbacks to notify developers when it detects changes in video resolution. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the resolution of the published stream changes multiple times and requires adjusting the encoding resolution of the publishing end and the rendering view size of the playing end for matching.

    For related APIs, please refer to [onMediaPlayerVideoSizeChanged](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback)

**Improvements**

1. Optimized server-side stream mixing and single-stream transcoding capabilities

2. Optimized AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) algorithm for better AEC performance

3. Optimized network connection strategy to enhance audio and video call experience

4. Optimized multi-device login logic

    After a user successfully logs in on device A, device A loses network connection; then logs in successfully on device B using the same userID. At this point, if device A's network recovers, the reconnection will fail and error code 1002086 will be thrown, indicating that this userID has already logged in on another device.

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed the crash issue that might occur when N-card hardware decoding exits on certain Windows devices

2. Fixed the restart strategy issue when the camera is abnormal on the Windows platform

3. Fixed the issue where the SDK could not receive network status change notifications when Windows or macOS system is in sleep mode, resulting in inaccurate network type judgment

    Express-Video SDK added [setAllPlayStreamVolume] interface for setting the volume size of all playing streams. That is, local users can control the playback volume of all audio streams.

    For related APIs, please refer to [setAllPlayStreamVolume](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~javascript_electron~class~ZegoExpressEngine#set-all-play-stream-volume)

**Bug Fixes**

1. Express-Video SDK fixed the parameter error issue of the [onAudioDeviceStateChanged](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback) callback interface.

---


## Version 2.17.3 <a id="2.17.3"></a>

**Release Date: 2022-03-28**

**Upgrade Essentials**

This major version upgrade includes three Breaking Changes. Please refer to "Deprecated and Removed" below for code adaptation.

**New Features**

1. Added debug assistant feature

    <Warning title="Note">


    This feature is only used during the development phase. Do not enable this feature in the online version. Make sure to disable this interface in the release version.

    </Warning>



    Added [enableDebugAssistant] interface. Developers call this interface to enable the debug assistant feature. The SDK will print logs to the console, and when exceptions occur in calls to other SDK interfaces, the UI will pop up a prompt for errors.


    For related APIs, please refer to [enableDebugAssistant](@enableDebugAssistant)


2. Added [setLogConfig] interface for setting log properties

    When developers need to customize log file size and path, they can call the [setLogConfig] interface to complete the configuration. It must be set before calling [createEngine] to take effect. If set after [createEngine], it will take effect at the next [createEngine] after [destroyEngine]. Once the [setLogConfig] interface is called, before [destroyEngine], that is, during the entire lifecycle of the engine, the old way of setting log size and path through [setEngineConfig] will be invalid. It is recommended that once you use this interface, always only use it to complete the needs of setting log path and size.

    For related APIs, please refer to [setLogConfig](@setLogConfig)

3. Added feature to set room mode

    The same user can join multiple rooms at the same time, and publish streams, play streams, send real-time messages and receive message callbacks in multiple rooms at the same time (currently supports joining up to 5 rooms at the same time by default). This feature can isolate messages and callbacks from multiple rooms, achieving more flexible mic connection business. ZEGO recommends it for cross-room mic connection and online education super small class scenarios.

    You need to call [ZegoRoomMode] to set multi-room mode before initializing the SDK, and then call the [loginRoom] interface to login to multiple rooms.

    For related APIs, please refer to [setRoomMode](@setRoomMode), [loginRoom](@loginRoom)

4. Support for pushing static images when camera is turned off

    When the camera is turned off, supports continuously pushing static images in JPEG/JPG, BMP and HEIF formats. For example, when the anchor goes to the background, they will actively turn off the camera, and at this time the audience side needs to display a picture of the anchor temporarily leaving.

    After initializing the SDK, before turning off the camera, set the path of the static image to be pushed through the [setDummyCaptureImagePath] interface. After starting normal stream publishing, when you call the [enableCamera] interface to turn off the camera, pushing static images will start, and when you call the [enableCamera] interface to turn on the camera, pushing static images will end.

    For related APIs, please refer to [setDummyCaptureImagePath](@setDummyCaptureImagePath)

5. Added voice detection feature and sound level callback for human voice part

    When developers monitor sound level callbacks, they often only care about the human voice part. They can call the [startSoundLevelMonitorWithConfig] interface, pass in "ZegoSoundLevelConfig", and enable VAD human voice detection.

    When developers monitor sound level callbacks, they often only care about the human voice part. They can call the [startSoundLevelMonitorWithConfig] interface, pass in "ZegoSoundLevelConfig", and enable VAD human voice detection. The SDK also adds parameters for whether to include human voice detection in the local capture sound level callback [onCapturedSoundLevelInfoUpdate] and remote audio sound level callback [onRemoteSoundLevelInfoUpdate].

    For related APIs, please refer to [startSoundLevelMonitorWithConfig](@startSoundLevelMonitorWithConfig), [onCapturedSoundLevelInfoUpdate](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback), [onRemoteSoundLevelInfoUpdate](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback)


6. Added custom audio processing feature

    Allows developers to perform custom processing on audio data after capturing audio data or before rendering remote audio data. This feature is usually used for scenarios such as "voice changing" and "beautifying voice".

    Added [enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessing], [enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessingAfterHeadphoneMonitor], [registerCustomAudioProcessPlugin] interfaces. Developers can call the [enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessing] or [enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessingAfterHeadphoneMonitor] interface to enable custom audio processing feature, and then register the audio processing plugin provided to you by the SDK through the [registerCustomAudioProcessPlugin] interface.

    For related APIs, please refer to [enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessing](@enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessing), [registerCustomAudioProcessPlugin](@registerCustomAudioProcessPlugin), [enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessingAfterHeadphoneMonitor](@enableCustomAudioCaptureProcessingAfterHeadphoneMonitor)

7. Added Token expiration management mechanism

    <Warning title="Note">


    Using this feature requires upgrading the SDK and contacting ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for configuration.

    </Warning>



    Different business scenarios have time limit restrictions on user permissions such as logging into rooms and publishing streams, which can be achieved through Token. This mechanism can make user permission management more secure and is commonly used in scenarios such as KTV and audio chat rooms.

    30 seconds before Token expires, the SDK will send a notification through the [onRoomTokenWillExpire] callback. After receiving this callback, developers need to get a new valid Token from their server and call the [renewToken] interface provided by the SDK to update the Token.

    For related APIs, please refer to [renewToken](@renewToken), [onRoomTokenWillExpire](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback)

8. Added local device exception callback

    Through the [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred] callback, you can set the device types to detect, such as cameras, speakers, microphones, etc. Developers can perform corresponding processing based on error callbacks for different device types.

    For related APIs, please refer to [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred](/real-time-video-electron-js/quick-start/setting-callback)

9. Added feature to set playing stream cache interval range value

    Through the [setPlayStreamBufferIntervalRange] interface, set the interval range for adaptive adjustment of playing stream playback cache. Generally, in poor network environments, increasing the playing cache of playing streams will significantly reduce audio and video stuttering, but will increase latency.

    For related APIs, please refer to [setPlayStreamBufferIntervalRange](@setPlayStreamBufferIntervalRange)


10. Support for ROI (region of interest) intelligent video encoding to improve specified region quality

    <Warning title="Note">


    Currently only specific video encoders support this feature. If you need to use it, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support.

    </Warning>



    Developers can call the [setCustomVideoCaptureRegionOfInterest](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=express-video-sdk_API~javascript_electron~class~ZegoExpressEngine#set-custom-video-capture-region-of-interest) interface to set the region of interest (ROI) for the custom video capture encoder of the specified publishing channel. With the same bitrate, the image quality within the ROI region is clearer.

    This feature is commonly used in scenarios such as remote control and face detection.

    For related APIs, please refer to [setCustomVideoCaptureRegionOfInterest](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=express-video-sdk_API~javascript_electron~class~ZegoExpressEngine#set-custom-video-capture-region-of-interest)

11. Electron supports macOS arm64 architecture

**Improvements**

1. Version number adjustment

    Starting from this version, the version number of ZEGO Express Electron SDK will be consistent with the version number of the dependent ZEGO Express Native SDK.

    <Note title="Note">


    Native mainly refers to Android, iOS, macOS and Windows platforms.

    </Note>



2. Release repository adjustment

    Starting from this version, ZEGO Express Electron SDK will be divided into two repositories on npm, separately providing [standard video feature package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zego-express-engine-electron) and [video feature package with whiteboard capabilities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zego-express-engine-electron-whiteboard).

3. Optimized authentication method

    For version 2.17.3 and above, when creating the engine, pass AppSign as empty or do not pass it, and must pass Token when logging into the room. After authentication passes, you can use real-time audio and video features. For details, please refer to [Using Token Authentication](/real-time-video-electron-js/communication/using-token-authentication).

    For versions below 2.17.3, when creating the engine, pass AppSign. After authentication passes, you can use real-time audio and video features.

    For related APIs, please refer to [createEngine](@createEngine), [loginRoom](@loginRoom)

4. Interface optimization

    - [startPlayingStream] interface adds "roomID" parameter, [startPublishingStream] interface adds "config" parameter, mainly used for multi-room features.
    - [startNetworkSpeedTest] interface adds "interval" parameter, which can be used to specify the callback time interval of the interface, making it convenient for users to customize.

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed the memory leak issue when using webgl rendering on certain Windows devices.


**Deprecated and Removed**

1. Deleted old [initWithProfile] interface

    To synchronize with ZEGO Express Native SDK, the [initWithProfile] interface is deleted in version 2.17.3 and above. Please use [createEngine] to implement the original functionality.

---


## Version 0.23.0 <a id="0.23.0"></a>

**Release Date: 2021-06-18**

**New Features**


1. Added experimental API feature

        ZEGO provides some technical previews or special custom features in RTC business through [callExperimentalAPI ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#event:onRecvExperimentalAPI). [onRecvExperimentalAPI ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#event:onRecvExperimentalAPI) can be used to receive information returned by some experimental interfaces with callbacks. To obtain the usage method or details of this feature, you can consult ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support.

        For related APIs, please refer to [callExperimentalAPI ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#event:onRecvExperimentalAPI), [onRecvExperimentalAPI ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#event:onRecvExperimentalAPI)

2. Added screenshot feature for publishing and playing streams

        Developers can call the [takePublishStreamSnapshot ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#takePublishStreamSnapshot) interface to take screenshots of the preview/publishing stream, and call the [takePlayStreamSnapshot ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#takePlayStreamSnapshot) interface to take screenshots of the specified playing stream. The screenshot resolution is the encoding resolution set in [setVideoConfig ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#setVideoConfig).

        This feature is commonly used in education-type scenarios. For example, in the classroom, based on students' performance and concentration, the student side can be asked to take preview screenshots, which are subsequently output as reports to parents.

        For related APIs, please refer to [takePublishStreamSnapshot ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#takePublishStreamSnapshot), [takePlayStreamSnapshot ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#takePlayStreamSnapshot)

3. Media player added screenshot feature

        Developers can call the [takeSnapshot ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoMediaPlayer.html#takeSnapshot) interface to take screenshots of the current playing frame of the media player. Screenshots can only be taken normally when the display control is set through the [setPlayerCanvas] interface and in the playing state.

        For related APIs, please refer to [takeSnapshot ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoMediaPlayer.html#takeSnapshot)


4. Added custom video pre-processing feature

        Video pre-processing is a process between capture and encoding. After developers capture video data themselves or get video data captured by the SDK, if ZEGO Express SDK's built-in basic AI effects and watermark features cannot meet developers' needs (for example, the AI effects effect cannot meet expectations), they can use other video processing types of SDKs (such as ZegoEffects SDK) to perform some special processing on the video, such as AI effects, adding watermarks or pendants, etc. This process is custom video pre-processing. Developers can call the [enableCustomVideoProcess ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#enableCustomVideoProcess) interface to enable this feature.

        For related APIs, please refer to [enableCustomVideoProcess ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#enableCustomVideoProcess)

5. Added mechanism for registering video pre-processing objects

        Call the [registerCustomVideoProcessPlugin ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#registerCustomVideoProcessPlugin) interface to register the plugin object to RTC, used to notify RTC that this plugin needs to be used for custom video pre-processing (such as AI effects).

        For related APIs, please refer to [registerCustomVideoProcessPlugin ](https://doc-zh-api.zego.im/Electron/ZegoExpressEngine.html#registerCustomVideoProcessPlugin)
