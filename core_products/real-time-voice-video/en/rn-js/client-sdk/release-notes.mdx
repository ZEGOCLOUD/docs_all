4. Added network speed test feature

    This feature supports uplink/downlink network speed testing and can be used to detect whether the network environment is suitable for publishing/playing streams of specified bitrates. Call the [startNetworkSpeedTest] interface to enable this feature, configure the "ZegoNetworkSpeedTestConfig" parameter to control the speed test process, and the speed test results will be notified through the [onNetworkSpeedTestQualityUpdate] callback.

5. Added room state change notification [roomStateChanged]

    When the room's connection state changes, the [roomStateChanged] callback will be triggered, providing more detailed connection state and state change reasons through the "ZegoRoomStateChangedReason" parameter.

    Related API please refer to [roomStateChanged](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/javascript_react-native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#roomstatechanged)

6. Added local preview first frame rendering callback

    This callback will be received after the first frame of video data is rendered.

7. Support for monitoring publishing stream address and protocol related information

    After initiating stream publishing, you can monitor the publishing status in real-time through the [publisherStreamEvent] callback. This callback returns the currently used publishing address, resource type, and protocol related information.

    Related API please refer to [publisherStreamEvent](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/javascript_react-native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html#publisherstreamevent)

8. Added [apiCalledResult] callback notification for receiving execution results

    Get detailed information about ZEGO SDK method execution results through the [apiCalledResult] callback.

9. Added CDN live streaming feature, and this feature supports using QUIC protocol for publishing and playing streams

    **Forward to CDN**: Forward to CDN refers to the process of pushing audio and video streams from ZEGO audio and video cloud to ZEGO's own CDN or third-party CDN.

    **Direct Publish to CDN**: Developers can directly push audio and video streams to CDN by specifying the specific CDN URL (or using ZEGO backend configuration), which needs to be set before publishing streams.

    **QUIC Protocol Publishing and Playing**: Mainly used to improve the unstable quality of CDN live streaming in weak network environments, but the improvement is limited. We recommend using low-latency live streaming to enjoy high-quality and low-latency live streaming services. Currently supports using Tencent and Wangsu's CDN live streaming products' QUIC protocol publishing and playing.

    Configure publishing protocol and QUIC version through the "ZegoCDNConfig" parameter in the [enablePublishDirectToCDN] interface. If you want to perform custom CDN playing with QUIC protocol, you need to configure playing protocol and QUIC version through the "ZegoPlayerConfig" parameter in [startPlayingStream].

    Related APIs please refer to [addPublishCdnUrl](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#addpublishcdnurl), [removePublishCdnUrl](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#removepublishcdnurl), [enablePublishDirectToCDN](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#enablepublishdirecttocdn)

10. Added [setPlayStreamVideoType] interface for setting playing video stream type

    When the publisher sets "codecID" to "SVC" through [setVideoConfig] (can be set before or after playing streams), the playing side can dynamically choose to use different stream types (small resolution is half of the standard layer). In cases of weak network or when the rendering UI window is small, you can choose to use small resolution video for playing to save bandwidth.

2. Removed test environment

    To reduce developers' understanding cost of environments, ZEGOCLOUD has unified the environment concept. Starting from this version, the test environment has been deprecated, and only the production environment is used. Developers who have integrated SDK before version 1.5.0 can refer to [Test Environment Deprecation Notice](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/12997) for SDK upgrade and code adjustments.
