# Running Example Source Code


This article describes how to quickly run the example source code and experience the basic audio and video call service.

## Prepare Environment

Please ensure that your development environment meets the following technical requirements:

* React Native 0.60 or above.
* iOS device or simulator running iOS 12.0 or above that supports audio and video (using a real device is recommended).
* Android device or simulator running Android 4.4 or above that supports audio and video (using a real device is recommended). If using a real device, enable the "Allow debugging" option.
* iOS/Android device is connected to the Internet.
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and it is recommended to use the Long Term Support (LTS) version displayed on the official website homepage.

## Prerequisites

You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to "Project Information" in [Console - Project Management](/console/project-info).

<Warning title="Warning">
The SDK also supports Token authentication. If you need to upgrade the authentication method, please refer to [How to Upgrade from AppSign Authentication to Token Authentication](/console/project-info).
</Warning>

## Get Example Source Code

<Card title="Example Source Code" href="https://github.com/zegoim/zego-express-example-topics-reactnative" target="_blank">
GitHub Download
</Card>
## Run Example Code

1. Use VS Code to open the project.
2. Modify the "/App.js" file and fill in the "appID" and "appSign" required for SDK initialization.

<Warning title="Warning">


    Please fill in correctly with the AppID and AppSign obtained in the [Prerequisites](/real-time-video-rn/quick-start/run-example-code) of this article, otherwise the example source code cannot run normally.

</Warning>

3. Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start.

<Warning title="Warning">
    When executing the `npm install` command to install the SDK, if the download from the npm official mirror is slow, you can execute the `npm set https://registry.npmmirror.com/` command to switch to the domestic mirror.
</Warning>



    ```javascript
    npm install
    npx react-native run-android/npx react-native run-ios
    ```

## Experience Video Call Features

Run the project on a real device. After running successfully, you can see the local video image.

For convenience, ZEGO provides a [Web Debugging Example](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html). On this page, enter the same AppID and RoomID, enter different UserIDs, and the corresponding [Token](/console/development-assistance/temporary-token), to join the same room and communicate with the real device. When the audio and video call starts successfully, you can hear the remote audio and see the remote video image.
