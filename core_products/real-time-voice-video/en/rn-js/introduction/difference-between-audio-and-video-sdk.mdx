# Differences Between Video Call SDK and Audio Call SDK

- - -

From version v2.20.0 onwards, there is no longer any API difference between Video Call and Audio Call. You can switch from the Video Call SDK to the Audio Call SDK at any time, and vice versa.

The only difference between the Audio Call SDK and the Video Call SDK is functional: For the Audio Call SDK, some video-related APIs (such as video encoding parameter settings, ZegoCanvas parameters for preview and stream playing, etc.) will have no effect after being set, but will not cause errors.

The APIs involved are as follows:

- [startPreview](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#startpreview)
    - In the Video Call SDK: Starts the microphone, starts the camera, and if a view is passed in the view parameter, the SDK will render the preview image in that view.
    - In the Audio Call SDK: Starts the microphone. Developers can set the canvas parameter to null when calling this API, or if there is an overload function, use the overload function of this API without the view parameter.

<Warning title="Warning">


When calling `startPreview` on the Audio Call Flutter / Electron / uni-app / Unity3D / React-Native SDK, the camera will still be started. Developers can call `enableCamera` to turn off the camera before calling `startPreview` to avoid the SDK requesting camera permissions.

</Warning>




- [startPlayingStream](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#startplayingstream)
    - In the Video Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the played stream, and if the developer passes a view in the view parameter, the SDK will render the video image of the played stream in that view.
    - In the Audio Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the played stream. Developers can set the view parameter to null when calling this API, or if there is an overload function, use the overload function of this API without the view parameter.

<Warning title="Warning">



All other video-related APIs have no effect in the Audio Call SDK. You can determine whether an API is video-related by the comment provided in the API: `Note: This function is only available in ZegoExpressVideo SDK!`. If this comment exists, it means the API is video-related.

</Warning>
