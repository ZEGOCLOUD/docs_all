# Headphone Monitor and Audio Channel Settings

- - -

## Overview

Headphone monitor is the monitoring of microphone capture. After inserting headphones (regular headphones or Bluetooth headphones) into the device, you can hear the sound captured by the device's microphone from the headphones.

## Prerequisites

Before using headphone monitor, ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK into the project and implemented basic audio and video streaming functionality. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-rn/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation](/real-time-video-rn/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Usage

After starting preview or starting stream publishing, call the [enableHeadphoneMonitor ](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react_native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#enableheadphonemonitor) interface to enable headphone monitor (i.e., enable capture monitoring), connect headphones, and after the user speaks, they can hear their own voice.

<Note title="Note">

After enabling the headphone monitor feature, it will only take effect when headphones are connected.
