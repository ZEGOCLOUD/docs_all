# Restrictions

This article describes the usage restrictions of the ZEGO Express SDK room service, including rate limits, string size limits, etc.

## Room

ZEGO's room service supports millions of users online in a single room. By default, the total login QPS of all users in each room is 200, which means a maximum of 200 users can log in to the same room per second.

<Note title="Note">


If you need to increase the limit, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for evaluation.
