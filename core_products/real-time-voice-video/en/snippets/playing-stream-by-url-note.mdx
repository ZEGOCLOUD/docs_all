- The authentication parameter refers to the string after the "?" in the URL (excluding "?"). For example, if the CDN playing stream URL is "rtmp://xxxx.yyy.zzz?a=qqq&b=www", the authentication parameter is "a=qqq&b=www".
- The authentication parameter in the playing stream URL is mainly used for anti-leeching. For specific rules, please consult your CDN provider or ZEGO Technical Support. If there is no authentication parameter, you can ignore the "authParam" field.
- Supported playing stream protocols include: RTMP, FLV, HLS (if you need to use HLS protocol for playing stream, please contact ZEGO Technical Support to enable it).
