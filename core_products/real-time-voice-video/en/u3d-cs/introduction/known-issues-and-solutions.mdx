# Known Issues and Solutions

## Unity 2022.3.17f1c1 has a recurring memory leak issue when unmanaged threads call managed code.

### Root Cause
Using Xcode Instruments Allocations for testing, it was found that a large amount of memory allocations were not released. All were caused by native SDK callback functions calling C# managed code, resulting in memory leaks.
