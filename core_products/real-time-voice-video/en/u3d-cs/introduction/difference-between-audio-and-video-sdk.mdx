# Differences Between Video Call SDK and Audio Call SDK

- - -

Starting from version v2.20.0, there are no longer API differences between Video Call and Audio Call. You can switch from Video Call SDK to Audio Call SDK at any time, and vice versa.

<Warning title="Warning">


Audio Call does not support running in WebGL environment.

</Warning>



There are only functional differences between Audio Call SDK and Video Call SDK: For Audio Call SDK, some video-related APIs (e.g., video encoding parameter settings, ZegoCanvas parameters for preview and playing stream, etc.) will have no effect after being set, but will not cause errors.

The involved APIs are as follows:

- [StartPreview](@StartPreview)
    - Effect in Video Call SDK: Starts the microphone and camera, and if RawImageVideoSurface or RendererVideoSurface rendering components are set, the SDK will render the preview view in the components.
    - Effect in Audio Call SDK: Starts the microphone. Developers do not need to set RawImageVideoSurface or RendererVideoSurface rendering components when calling this API.

<Warning title="Warning">



When calling `StartPreview` in the Audio Call Flutter / Electron / uni-app / Unity3D / React-Native SDK, the camera will still be started; developers can call `enableCamera` before calling `StartPreview` to disable the camera to avoid the SDK requesting camera permissions.

</Warning>





- [StartPlayingStream](@StartPlayingStream)
    - Effect in Video Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the played stream, and if RawImageVideoSurface or RendererVideoSurface rendering components are set, the SDK will render the preview view in the components.
    - Effect in Audio Call SDK: Starts playing stream, plays the audio of the played stream. Developers do not need to set RawImageVideoSurface or RendererVideoSurface rendering components when calling this API.

<Warning title="Warning">



All other video-related APIs have no effect in Audio Call SDK. You can determine whether an API is video-related by the comment provided in the API: `Note: This function is only available in ZegoExpressVideo SDK!`. If this comment exists, it means the API is video-related.

</Warning>
