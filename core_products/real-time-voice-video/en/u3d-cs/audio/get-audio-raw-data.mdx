# Getting Audio Raw Data

- - -

## Function Overview

The SDK provides developers with the function to get raw audio data. The obtained raw audio data format is PCM. Developers can write this data to local devices to implement audio recording.

## Prerequisites

Before getting raw audio data, please ensure:

- You have created a project in [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic audio and video streaming functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](../quick-start/integrating-sdk.mdx) and [Quick Start - Implementation](../quick-start/implementing-video-call.mdx).



## Usage Steps

### 1 Initialize SDK

Please refer to "Create Engine" in [Quick Start - Implementation](../quick-start/implementing-video-call.mdx).

### 2 Enable Getting Raw Audio Data Function

Developers can call the [startAudioDataObserver](@startAudioDataObserver) interface to enable raw audio data callback monitoring. The callback audio data types are [ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask](@-ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask), including `CAPTURED`, `PLAYBACK`, `MIXED`, `PLAYER`. All four callback types need to be enabled.

```cs
ZegoAudioFrameParam param = new ZegoAudioFrameParam();
param.channel = ZegoAudioChannel.Stereo;
param.sampleRate = ZegoAudioSampleRate.ZegoAudioSampleRate16K;pap
uint bitmask = 0;
// Add bitmask to enable the callback switch for captured audio data.
// The bitmask values corresponding to capture, playback, mix, and play are: CAPTURED=1, PLAYBACK=2, MIXED=4, PLAYER=8. The final value of bitmask is 15, which means that raw data callbacks for capture, playback, mix, and play will be triggered simultaneously.
bitmask |= (uint)ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask.Captured;
bitmask |= (uint)ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask.Playback;
bitmask |= (uint)ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask.Mixed;
bitmask |= (uint)ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask.Player;
engine.StartAudioDataObserver(bitmask, param);

```

### 3 Set Callback to Receive and Process Raw Audio Data

Developers can implement callbacks [onCapturedAudioData](@onCapturedAudioData), [onPlaybackAudioData](@onPlaybackAudioData), [onMixedAudioData](@onMixedAudioData), [onPlayerAudioData](@onPlayerAudioData) as needed, corresponding to the four audio data types in the above [ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask](@-ZegoAudioDataCallbackBitMask) respectively.

```cs
void OnCapturedAudioData(IntPtr data, uint dataLength, ZegoAudioFrameParam param)
{
    // Local captured audio data, callback can be received after publishing stream
}

void OnPlaybackAudioData(IntPtr data, uint dataLength, ZegoAudioFrameParam param)
{
    // Audio data played by the SDK. When the engine is started and not in the playing stream state and the media player is not playing media files, the callback audio data is muted audio data
}

void OnMixedAudioData(IntPtr data, uint dataLength, ZegoAudioFrameParam param)
{
    // Callback of audio data mixed with local captured audio and SDK played audio
}

void OnPlayerAudioData(IntPtr data, uint dataLength, ZegoAudioFrameParam param, string streamID)
{
    // Remote playing stream audio data, callback of each playing stream data after starting to play stream
}

```

### 4 Stop Audio Data Callback Monitoring



If you want to stop audio data callback monitoring, you can call the [stopAudioDataObserver ](@stopAudioDataObserver) interface.

```cs
engine.StopAudioDataObserver();
```
