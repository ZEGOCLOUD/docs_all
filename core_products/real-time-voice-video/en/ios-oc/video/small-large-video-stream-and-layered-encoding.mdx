# Video Large/Small Stream and Layered Encoding

- - -

## Feature Introduction

When the following requirements appear in developers' co-hosting or stream mixing business scenarios, it is recommended to use the `Video Layered Encoding` or `Video Large/Small Stream Encoding` features provided by the SDK:

- Need different terminals to display video streams of different quality.
- Need to maintain smooth co-hosting in poor network environments.
- Need to adaptively pull the quality of video streams based on network status.


`Video Layered Encoding (H.264 SVC)` is an extension of H.264 AVC, supporting bitstreams with layered characteristics. `Video Large/Small Stream Encoding (H.264 DualStream)` references the concept of H.264 SVC, ensuring smooth experience for terminals with different network and device performance through video stream layering.

Both encoding methods divide the bitstream into a "base layer" and an "enhancement layer", providing better experience for users with different network states and device performance. The base layer guarantees the most basic video quality, while the enhancement layer is a supplement to the base layer. For users with better networks, they can pull the enhancement layer for better experience; for users with poor network states, pulling only the base layer can guarantee basic video quality. The following is a detailed comparison of the two features:

## Prerequisites

Before implementing both video encoding features, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic audio and video stream publishing and playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Flow](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call).



## Implementation Steps

### Layered Video Encoding

#### Enable layered video encoding

Before calling [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream), call the [setVideoConfig](@setVideoConfig-ZegoExpressEngine) interface to set the parameter `codecID` in the [ZegoVideoConfig](@-ZegoVideoConfig) class to `ZegoVideoCodecIDSVC` to enable layered video encoding; and call the [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) interface to start publishing stream.

```objc
ZegoVideoConfig *videoConfig = [[ZegoVideoConfig alloc] init];
videoConfig.codecID = ZegoVideoCodecIDSVC;
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setVideoConfig:videoConfig];

self.streamID = @"0012";
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] startPublishingStream:self.streamID];
```

<Note title="Note">


Setting "codecID" to "ZegoVideoCodecIDDefault", "ZegoVideoCodecIDVP8" or "ZegoVideoCodecIDH265" can disable this feature.
</Note>

#### Specify the layered video to pull

After the publishing end enables layered video encoding, users at the playing end can call the [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType) interface before or after playing stream, passing in specific playing parameters to pull specific video layers. Currently supported video layers are as follows:

|Enumeration Value|Description|
|-|-|
|ZegoVideoStreamTypeDefault| (Default) Automatically select the appropriate video layer based on network status, for example, only pull the base layer in weak networks.|
|ZegoVideoStreamTypeSmall| Base layer, small resolution type.|
|ZegoVideoStreamTypeBig| Enhancement layer, large resolution type.|

```objc
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setPlayStreamVideoType:ZegoVideoStreamTypeBig streamID:self.streamID];
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] startPlayingStream:self.streamID canvas:playCanvas];
```

### Large/Small Stream Video Encoding

The implementation steps of `Large/Small Stream Video Encoding` are basically the same as `Layered Video Encoding`, except that `Large/Small Stream Video Encoding` supports setting the resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the large stream and small stream separately before publishing stream.

#### Enable large/small stream video encoding

Before calling [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream), call the [setVideoConfig](@setVideoConfig-ZegoExpressEngine) interface to set the parameter `codecID` in the [ZegoVideoConfig](@-ZegoVideoConfig) class to `ZegoVideoCodecIDH264DualStream` to enable large/small stream video encoding; and call the [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) interface to start publishing stream.

```objc
ZegoVideoConfig *videoConfig = [[ZegoVideoConfig alloc] init];
videoConfig.codecID = ZegoVideoCodecIDH264DualStream;
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setVideoConfig:videoConfig];
```

<Note title="Note">


Setting "codecID" to "ZegoVideoCodecIDDefault", "ZegoVideoCodecIDVP8" or "ZegoVideoCodecIDH265" can disable this feature.
</Note>

#### Set parameters for base layer and enhancement layer

Through the [setPublishDualStreamConfig](@setPublishDualStreamConfig) interface, set the resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the large stream and small stream separately, and call the [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) interface to start publishing stream.

<Warning title="Note">


- Must specify parameters for both large stream and small stream at the same time for the [setPublishDualStreamConfig](@setPublishDualStreamConfig) interface to take effect.
- The "ratio" of the resolution set for the large stream and small stream needs to remain consistent, otherwise calling the [setPublishDualStreamConfig](@setPublishDualStreamConfig) interface will result in an error.
</Warning>

```objc
NSMutableArray<ZegoPublishDualStreamConfig*>* dualStreamConfig = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:2];
ZegoPublishDualStreamConfig* config_big = [[ZegoPublishDualStreamConfig alloc] init];
config_big.streamType = ZegoVideoStreamTypeBig;
config_big.fps = 15;
config_big.bitrate = 1200;
config_big.encodeResolution = CGSizeMake(540,960);

[dualStreamConfig addObject:config_big];

ZegoPublishDualStreamConfig* config_small = [[ZegoPublishDualStreamConfig alloc] init];
config_small.streamType = ZegoVideoStreamTypeSmall;
config_small.fps = 15;
config_small.bitrate = 300;
config_small.encodeResolution = CGSizeMake(180,320);

[dualStreamConfig addObject:config_small];

[ZegoExpressEngine.sharedEngine setPublishDualStreamConfig:dualStreamConfig channel:ZegoPublishChannelMain];

self.streamID = @"0012";
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] startPublishingStream:self.streamID];
```


#### Specify the video stream to pull

After the publishing end enables video large/small stream encoding, users at the playing end can call the [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType) interface before or after playing stream, passing in specific playing parameters to pull specific video layers. Currently supported video layers are as follows:

|Enumeration Value|Description|
|-|-|
|ZegoVideoStreamTypeDefault| (Default) Automatically select the appropriate video layer based on network status, for example, only pull the base layer in weak networks.|
|ZegoVideoStreamTypeSmall| Base layer, small resolution type.|
|ZegoVideoStreamTypeBig| Enhancement layer, large resolution type.|

```objc
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setPlayStreamVideoType:ZegoVideoStreamTypeBig streamID:self.streamID];
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] startPlayingStream:self.streamID canvas:playCanvas];
```

## FAQ

1. **For relaying to or directly publishing to CDN, when viewers pull streams from CDN, are layered video encoding and large/small streams effective? What are the bitrate and resolution of streams pulled from CDN?**

    - `Video Layered Encoding` and `Video Large/Small Stream Encoding` use ZEGO's private protocol. The playing end can only pull different layered video streams when pulling RTC streams or L3 streams from ZEGO servers.

    - In the direct CDN publishing scenario, since it does not go through ZEGO servers, the layering of the bitstream is invalid, and the SDK will fall back to H.264 encoding. The resolution and bitrate of streams pulled from CDN are consistent with the resolution and bitrate set by the publishing user.

    - In the relay to CDN scenario, since CDN pulling does not use ZEGO's private protocol, the stream relayed by ZEGO servers to CDN servers does not support layered video encoding and video large/small stream encoding. You can only choose one from relaying the base layer or relaying the enhancement layer. The resolution, bitrate, and frame rate when pulling from CDN depend on whether the relayed layer is the base layer or the enhancement layer.

        <Warning title="Note">


        When relaying to CDN, the enhancement layer is relayed by default. If the business needs to relay the base layer to CDN, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support for configuration.
