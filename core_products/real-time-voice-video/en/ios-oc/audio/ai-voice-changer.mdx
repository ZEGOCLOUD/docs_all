### Applicable Scenarios

This feature can be used in the following real-time scenarios to achieve user timbre transformation.

- Social chat
- Game voice
- Audio and video live streaming
- Virtual human

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the AI voice changer feature, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic audio and video publishing and playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Flow](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call).



## Usage Steps

Developers can complete the related settings of AI voice changer according to the following steps:

### 1 Enable permission

Please confirm that you have contacted ZEGO technical support for special packaging and enabled the AI voice changer permission.

### 2 Initialize and login room

For the specific process of initializing and logging in to the room, please refer to "[Create Engine](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call)" and "[Login Room](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call)" in the implementation video call documentation.

### 3 Initialize AI voice changer engine instance

1. Call the [createAIVoiceChanger](@createAIVoiceChanger) interface to create an AI voice changer engine instance.

    Currently only supports creating one instance at the same time. Creating again before calling the [destroyAIVoiceChanger](@destroyAIVoiceChanger) interface to destroy the instance will return nil.

    ```objc
    // Create AI voice changer engine instance
    self.aiVoiceChanger = [[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] createAIVoiceChanger];
    ```

2. Call the [ZegoAIVoiceChanger.setEventHandler](@setEventHandler-ZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to set the AI voice changer engine event callback.

    ```objc
    // Set AI voice changer engine event callback
    [self.aiVoiceChanger setEventHandler:self];
    ```

3. Call the [ZegoAIVoiceChanger.initEngine](@initEngine-ZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to initialize the AI voice changer engine instance.

    <Warning title="Warning">


    The [ZegoAIVoiceChanger.initEngine](@initEngine-ZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface must be called before the [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) interface to take effect.
    </Warning>

    ```objc
    // Initialize AI voice changer engine
    [self.aiVoiceChanger initEngine];
    ```

### 4 Update AI voice changer engine model

Call the [ZegoAIVoiceChanger.update](@update-ZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to update the AI voice changer engine model. **The AI voice changer engine model file is large, and the first update will take a long time. Please wait patiently.**

```objc
// Update AI voice changer engine model
[self.aiVoiceChanger update];
```

### 5 Get timbre list

Call the [ZegoAIVoiceChanger.getSpeakerList](@getSpeakerList-ZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to get the available timbre list.

The available timbre list will be returned through the [ZegoAIVoiceChangerEventHandler.onGetSpeakerList](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~objective-c_ios~class~ZegoAIVoiceChangerEventHandler#ai-voice-changer-on-update) callback interface.

```objc
// Get available timbre list
[self.aiVoiceChanger getSpeakerList];
```

### 6 Set target timbre

Call the [ZegoAIVoiceChanger.setSpeaker](@setSpeaker-ZegoAIVoiceChanger) interface to set the timbre. The selection of timbre can be obtained through [5 Get Timbre List](/real-time-video-ios-oc/audio/ai-voice-changer).

Setting the timbre ID to 0 means using the original voice.

```objc
// Set timbre
int speakerID = 0; // Timbre ID
[self.aiVoiceChanger setSpeaker:speakerID];
```

### 7 Destroy AI voice changer engine instance

After using the feature, call the [destroyAIVoiceChanger](@destroyAIVoiceChanger) interface to destroy the AI voice changer engine instance and release resources such as the microphone.

```objc
// Destroy AI voice changer engine instance
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] destroyAIVoiceChanger:self.aiVoiceChanger];
```

## FAQ

1. **When compiling the project, if an error similar to "Undefined symbol" appears, how should I handle it?**

    ```objc
    Undefined symbol:
    _$s10ObjectiveC8ObjCBoolVMn
    ```

   When the above error occurs, you can add a blank file ending with `.swift` in your project directory and recompile.
