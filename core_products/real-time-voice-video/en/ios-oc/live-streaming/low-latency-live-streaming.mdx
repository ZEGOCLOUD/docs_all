---

## Feature Introduction


ZEGO [Ultra Low Latency Live Streaming](/live-streaming-ios/introduction/overview) (Low-Latency Live Streaming, L3) is born for high-quality experience, creating the ultimate live streaming experience with ultra-low latency, super-strong synchronization, extreme weak network resistance, ultra-low stuttering, ultra-clear picture quality, and first-frame instant opening. It is a "hexagon warrior" among live streaming distribution products.

Compared with traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming provides more stable and higher-quality live streaming distribution services based on full-link self-developed private protocols, Massive Sequential Data Network (MSDN), and end-to-end monitoring, helping the business side solve "live streaming experience" pain points, and is the common choice of many leading live streaming customers.


<Warning title="Note">

<table>

<tbody><tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Characteristics</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra Low Latency</td>
<td>Live streaming latency of 600 ms ～ 1000 ms under normal network conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Super Strong Synchronization
</td>
<td>Millisecond-level synchronization, synchronization error between different viewers < 400ms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extreme Weak Network Resistance</td>
<td>Supports extreme weak network resistance, up to 80% packet loss without disconnection, stable playback even in complex network environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ultra Low Stuttering</td>

## Prerequisites

Before implementing ultra-low latency live streaming features, please ensure:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated the ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic audio and video publishing and playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Flow](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Usage Steps

Set the `resourceMode` parameter of [ZegoPlayerConfig](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~ObjectiveC_ios~class~zego-player-config) to `ZegoStreamResourceModeOnlyL3`, call the [startPlayingStream](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Express_Video_SDK_API~ObjectiveC_ios~class~zego-express-engine#start-playing-stream-canvas-config) interface, and pull the remote published ultra-low latency live streaming stream according to the passed stream ID parameter `streamID`, to implement ultra-low latency live streaming functionality.

```objc
ZegoPlayerConfig *playerConfig = [[ZegoPlayerConfig alloc] init];
playerConfig.resourceMode = ZegoStreamResourceModeOnlyL3;
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] startPlayingStream: streamID canvas: playCanvas config:playerConfig];
```
