# ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager

## ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager

*Declared in `ZegoExpressDefines.h`*

### Methods
<ParamField
  name="setEventHandler:"
  prototype="- (void)setEventHandler:(nullable id<[ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataEventHandler](../../api-reference/class#zegorealtimesequentialdataeventhandler)>) handler;"
  desc="Sets up the real-time sequential data event handler."
  parent_file="Declared in \`ZegoExpressDefines.h\`"
  parent_name="ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager"
  parent_type="class">
**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| handler | nullable id\<[ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataEventHandler](../../api-reference/class#zegorealtimesequentialdataeventhandler)\> | Event handler for real-time sequential data |

**Details**

Set up real-time sequential data callback to monitor callbacks such as sending data results， receiving data, etc.

<Note title="">
- **When to call**: After create the [ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager] instance.
- **Caution**: Calling this function will overwrite the callback set by the last call to this function.
</Note>

- **Available since**: 2.14.0
- **Restrictions**: None.

<ParamField
  name="startBroadcasting:"
  prototype="- (void)startBroadcasting:(NSString *) streamID;"
  desc="Start broadcasting real-time sequential data stream."
  parent_file="Declared in \`ZegoExpressDefines.h\`"
  parent_name="ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager"
  parent_type="class">
**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| streamID | NSString * | Stream ID, a string of up to 256 characters.<br/>  Caution:<br/>  1. Need to be globally unique within the entire AppID (Note that it cannot be the same as the stream ID passed in [startPublishingStream]). If in the same AppID, different users publish each stream and the stream ID is the same, which will cause the user to publish the stream failure. You cannot include URL keywords, otherwise publishing stream and playing stream will fails.<br/>  2. Only support numbers, English characters and '-', '_'. |

**Details**

This function allows users to broadcast their local real-time sequential data stream to the ZEGO RTC server, and other users in the same room can subscribe to the real-time sequential data stream for intercommunication through "streamID".

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: Before sending real-time sequential data, you need to call this function to start broadcasting.
- **When to call**: After creating the [ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager] instance.
- **Caution**: After calling this function, you will receive the [onPublisherStateUpdate] callback to tell you the broadcast state (publish state) of this stream. After the broadcast is successful, other users in the same room will receive the [onRoomStreamUpdate] callback to tell them this stream has been added to the room.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| streamID | NSString * | The ID of the stream that needs to stop broadcasting. |

**Details**

This function allows users to stop broadcasting their local real-time sequential data stream.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: When you no longer need to send real-time sequential data, you need to call this function to stop broadcasting.
- **When to call**: After creating the [ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataManager] instance.
- **Caution**: After calling this function, you will receive the [onPublisherStateUpdate] callback to tell you the broadcast state (publish state) of this stream. After stopping the broadcast, other users in the same room will receive the [onRoomStreamUpdate] callback to tell them this stream has been deleted from the room.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | NSData * | The real-time sequential data to be sent. |

| callback | nullable [ZegoRealTimeSequentialDataSentCallback](../../api-reference/class#zegorealtimesequentialdatasentcallback) | Send real-time sequential data result callback. |

**Details**

This function can be used to send real-time sequential data on the stream currently being broadcast.

**Details**

This function allows users to subscribe to the real-time sequential data stream of remote users from the ZEGO RTC server.

<Note title="">
- **Use cases**: When you need to receive real-time sequential data sent from other remote users, you need to call this function to start subscribing to the stream broadcasted by other remote users.
