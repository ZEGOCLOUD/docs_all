## 1003xxx Publishing Stream Related Error Codes

After calling the publishing stream interface, or if an exception occurs during publishing stream, developers can obtain relevant error codes from `onPublisherStateUpdate`. Please handle them accordingly according to the following error codes.

After calling interfaces such as relaying to CDN or updating stream extra information, developers can obtain relevant error codes from the callback parameter of the API (Java is anonymous class, OC is block, C++ is lambda).

> Handling the situation where the publishing stream callback error code is not 0:
>
> 1. When state is PUBLISHER_STATE_NO_PUBLISH and errcode is not 0, it indicates that publishing stream has failed and will not retry publishing stream anymore. At this time, you can display a publishing stream failure prompt on the interface;
> 2. When state is PUBLISHER_STATE_PUBLISH_REQUESTING and errcode is not 0, it indicates retrying to publish stream. At this time, if publishing stream is not successful after exceeding the retry time, a publishing stream failure notification will be thrown.

## 1004xxx Playing Stream Related Error Codes

After calling the playing stream interface, or if an exception occurs during playing stream, developers can obtain relevant error codes from the `onPlayerStateUpdate` playing stream status callback. Please handle them accordingly according to the following error codes.

> Handling the situation where the playing stream callback error code is not 0:
>
> 1. When state is PLAYER_STATE_NO_PLAY and errcode is not 0, it indicates that playing stream has failed and will not retry playing stream anymore. At this time, you can display a playing stream failure prompt on the interface;
> 2. When state is PLAYER_STATE_PLAY_REQUESTING and errcode is not 0, it indicates retrying to play stream. At this time, if playing stream is not successful after exceeding the retry time, a playing stream failure notification will be thrown.
