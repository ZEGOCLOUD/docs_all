# Multi-Source Capture

- - -
## Feature Overview

Multi-source capture is used to manage audio/video source configurations for each channel. Through this capability, you can flexibly and quickly implement real-time interaction with different audio/video content, such as screen sharing, audio mixing, etc.

The main capabilities and limitations of multi-source capture are as follows:

- The publishing channel supports setting multiple audio/video sources, but the same audio/video source can only be occupied by one channel.
- The main channel's audio/video sources support dynamic switching and audio mixing capability. The auxiliary channel only supports specifying capture sources before publishing and does not support mixing.
- When capturing screen, only iOS and Android platforms support simultaneous video and audio capture; other platforms only support video capture. If audio capture is needed, developers need to implement related logic themselves.

## Example Source Code

Please refer to [Download Example Source Code](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/run-example-code) to get the source code.

For related source code, please check files in the "/ZegoExpressExample/Examples/Others/MultiVideoSource" directory.

## Prerequisites

Before using the multi-source capture feature, ensure that:

- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, see [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated the ZEGO Express SDK into your project and implemented basic audio/video streaming functionality. For details, see [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Flow](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call).


## Implementation Flow

<Warning title="Caution">



Real-time audio products only support setting audio capture sources.
</Warning>



### 1 Create ZegoExpressEngine Engine

For the process of creating the ZegoExpressEngine engine, please refer to [Create Engine](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call) in implementing video call.

```objc
ZegoEngineProfile *profile = [[ZegoEngineProfile alloc] init];
profile.appID = [KeyCenter appID];
profile.appSign = [KeyCenter appSign];
profile.scenario = ZegoScenarioDefault;
[ZegoExpressEngine createEngineWithProfile:profile eventHandler:self];
```

### 2 Set Audio/Video Capture Sources

1. Call the [setVideoSource](@setVideoSource) interface to set the video capture source.

```objc
/** Use camera as video capture source */
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setVideoSource:ZegoVideoSourceTypeCamera];
```

<Note title="Note">

- If you need to use custom video capture as the video capture source, you need to set the video capture source type to [ZegoVideoSourceTypeCustom](@ZegoVideoSourceTypeCustom), call the [enableCustomVideoCapture](@enableCustomVideoCapture) interface to set the video frame data type to be sent, and call [sendCustomVideoCapturePixelBuffer](@sendCustomVideoCapturePixelBuffer), [sendCustomVideoCaptureTextureData](@sendCustomVideoCaptureTextureData), or [sendCustomVideoCaptureEncodedData](@sendCustomVideoCaptureEncodedData) interfaces to send video frame data to the SDK. For details, please refer to [Advanced Features - Custom Video Capture](/real-time-video-ios-oc/video/custom-video-capture).
- If you need to use a media player as the video capture source, you need to call the [createMediaPlayer](@createMediaPlayer) interface to create a media player first, then call the [setVideoSource](@setVideoSource) interface to set the video capture source type to [ZegoVideoSourceTypePlayer](@ZegoVideoSourceTypePlayer) and set the media player instance index used by the video capture source, and then use the newly created media player to load resources and play. For details, please refer to [Media Player](/real-time-video-ios-oc/other/media-player).
- If you need to use screen sharing as the video capture source, you need to set the video capture source type to [ZegoVideoSourceTypeScreenCapture](@ZegoVideoSourceTypeScreenCapture) and start screen sharing to push screen sharing video data to the SDK. For details, please refer to [Screen Sharing](/real-time-video-ios-oc/video/screen-sharing).

</Note>


2. Call the [setAudioSource](@setAudioSource) interface to set the audio capture source.

    - Set audio capture source only

        ```objc
        /** Use microphone as audio capture source */
        [[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setAudioSource:ZegoAudioSourceTypeMicrophone];
        ```

    - Set audio capture source and mix configuration at the same time

        ```objc
        ZegoAudioSourceMixConfig *audioSourceMixConfig = [ZegoAudioSourceMixConfig defaultConfig];

        /** Mix the sound played by the media player with index 0 */
        audioSourceMixConfig.mediaPlayerCount = 1;
        audioSourceMixConfig.mediaPlayerIndexList = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*1);
        audioSourceMixConfig.mediaPlayerIndexList[0] = 0;

        /** Mix the sound played by the audio effect player with index 0 */
        audioSourceMixConfig.audioEffectPlayerCount = 1;
        audioSourceMixConfig.audioEffectPlayerIndexList = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)*1);
        audioSourceMixConfig.audioEffectPlayerIndexList[0] = 0;

        /** Use microphone as audio capture source and set mix configuration */
        [[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setAudioSource:ZegoAudioSourceTypeMicrophone config:audioSourceMixConfig];

        free(audioSourceMixConfig.mediaPlayerIndexList);
        free(audioSourceMixConfig.audioEffectPlayerIndexList);
        ```

<Note title="Note">

- If you need to use custom audio capture as the audio capture source, you need to set the audio capture source type to [ZegoAudioSourceTypeCustom](@ZegoAudioSourceTypeCustom), and call interfaces such as [sendCustomAudioCaptureAACData](@sendCustomAudioCaptureAACData) or [sendCustomAudioCapturePCMData](@sendCustomAudioCapturePCMData) to send audio data to the SDK. For details, please refer to [Advanced Features - Custom Audio Capture and Rendering](/real-time-video-ios-oc/audio/custom-audio-capture-and-rendering).
- If you need to use a media player as the audio capture source, you need to set the audio capture source type to [ZegoAudioSourceTypeMediaPlayer](@ZegoAudioSourceTypeMediaPlayer), call the [createMediaPlayer](@createMediaPlayer) interface to create a media player, and then use the newly created media player to load resources and play. For details, please refer to [Media Player](/real-time-video-ios-oc/other/media-player).

### 4 (Optional) Switch Audio/Video Capture Sources

1. Call the [setVideoSource](@setVideoSource) interface to switch the video capture source.

```objc
/** Use screen sharing as video capture source */
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setVideoSource:ZegoVideoSourceTypeScreenCapture];
```

2. Call the [setAudioSource](@setAudioSource) interface to switch the audio capture source.

```objc
/** Use media player as audio capture source */
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] setAudioSource:ZegoAudioSourceTypeMediaPlayer];
```

### 5 Stop Publishing Stream

```objc
/** Stop publishing stream */
[[ZegoExpressEngine sharedEngine] stopPublishingStream];
```


## FAQ


<Accordion title="How to capture screen video and system audio?" defaultOpen="false">
If you need to capture screen video and system audio, please refer to [Screen Sharing](/real-time-video-ios-oc/video/screen-sharing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does it support setting multiple media players?" defaultOpen="false">
Yes, but note that the same player instance can only be occupied by one channel.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the limitations when combining video sources and audio sources?" defaultOpen="false">
The limitations for combining video sources and audio sources are as follows:
1. The main channel cannot use the media player's video or audio source.
2. When the auxiliary channel uses a media player as the audio/video source, the main channel needs to use and start the microphone device (`enableMicrophone`).
If you don't need microphone sound on the main channel, you can disable audio publishing through `mutePublishStreamAudio` to keep the microphone started.
3. Only when the main channel uses camera video source or microphone audio source, the auxiliary channel copying the main channel's video source or audio source can take effect.
4. The main channel's audio source cannot be set to `None`, otherwise audio will not be able to render.
