# Geofencing

## Feature Introduction


Geofencing refers to limiting audio, video, and signaling data transmission to a specific region to meet regional data privacy and security related regulations, that is, limiting access to audio and video services in a specific region. For example, when the specified geofencing region is Europe, regardless of the App user's region, the region actually accessed by the SDK will be Europe.

<td>May be significantly affected</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<Warning title="Note">
- If all servers in the specified geofencing region are unavailable, the SDK will directly report an error.
- Since there is cross-regional public internet between the specified geofencing region and the App user's region, poor public internet network quality will cause the audio and video experience to be affected.
</Warning>

Currently, the SDK supports configuring the following regions:

If you need to support more regions, please contact ZEGO technical support.
</Note>


|Region|Enumeration|
|-|-|
|Mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan|CN|
|North America|NA|
|India|IN|
|Europe|EU|
|Asia, excluding Mainland China and India|AS|

## Prerequisites

Before using the geofencing feature, please ensure:
- You have created a project in the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - Project Information](/console/project-info).
- You have integrated the ZEGO Express SDK in the project and implemented basic audio and video publishing and playing functions. For details, please refer to [Quick Start - Integration](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/integrating-sdk) and [Quick Start - Implementation Flow](/real-time-video-ios-oc/quick-start/implementing-video-call).

## Implementation Flow

### 1 Enable geofencing permission

Geofencing capability requires charging in some cases. Please contact ZEGO sales to confirm and enable geofencing permission.


### 2 Set geofencing

- Geofencing information: Includes geofencing type and geofencing region list.
- Geofencing type: Includes two types: Include and Exclude. The geofencing type will act on the geofencing region list.
    - Include: Indicates all regions in the region list are included within the geofencing.
    - Exclude: Indicates all regions in the region list are excluded from the geofencing.

Before creating the SDK, call the [setGeoFence](@setGeoFence) interface to set geofencing information.


<Warning title="Note">
Please configure geofencing information before calling [createEngineWithProfile](@createEngineWithProfile), otherwise it will be invalid.
</Warning>


```objc
// Example of setting Include mode
ZegoGeoFenceType geo_fence_type = ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_TYPE_INCLUDE;//Set Include mode
NSMutableArray<NSNumber*> *geo_fence_area = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; // Set region list information, at least 1 must be set, at most not greater than the number supported by the SDK
[geo_fence_area addObject:ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_CN];
[geo_fence_area addObject:ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_NA];
[ZegoExpressEngine setGeoFence:geo_fence_type area:geo_fence_area];// This interface is a static method, called before createEngineWithProfile

// Example of setting Exclude mode
ZegoGeoFenceType geo_fence_type = ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_TYPE_EXCLUDE;//Set Exclude mode
NSMutableArray<NSNumber*> *geo_fence_area = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];// Set region list information, at least 1 must be set, at most not greater than or equal to the number supported by the SDK
[geo_fence_area addObject:ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_CN];
[geo_fence_area addObject:ZEGO_GEO_FENCE_AREA_CODE_NA];
[ZegoExpressEngine setGeoFence:geo_fence_type area:geo_fence_area];// This interface is a static method, called before createEngineWithProfile
```

### 3 Integrate other features

After completing geofencing settings, you can proceed with other feature integration.
