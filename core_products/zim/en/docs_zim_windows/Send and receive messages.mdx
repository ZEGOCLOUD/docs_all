# Send and receive messages

---

This document describes how to use the ZIM SDK (In-app Chat) to send and receive messages.

## Solution

The following shows the access solution that the ZIM SDK provides.

![/Pics/InappChat/im_solution_en.png](https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/InappChat/im_solution_en.png)

In this solution, you will need to implement the following business logic based on your actual business requirements:

- The logic for managing the users on the client, and the logic for distributing user ID for users to log in.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

- Go to [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com), and do the following:
  - Create a project, get the **AppID** and **AppSign**.
  - Activate the **In-app Chat** service (as shown in the following figure).

- Visual Studio 2015 or later
- Windows 7 or later

## Integrate the SDK

### Optional: Create a project

Skip this step if a project already exists.

<Accordion title="Create a new project" defaultOpen="false">

1. Open Xcode, and in the **Welcome to Xcode** window, click **Create a new Xcode project** or select **File > New > Project**. In the dialog that appears, select the **iOS** tab, then select **App** in the **Application** section.
<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/QuickStart/NewProject_1.png" /></Frame>

2. Fill in items or choose options for the new project, click **Next** after configuration is completed.

**Product Name** and **Organization Identifier** are required, which will be used for creating the App UID - **Bundle Identifier**.

</Accordion>


### Import the SDK 

1. Download the latest version of SDK from [SDK downloads](./Client%20SDKs/SDK%20downloads.mdx).
2. Extract the files from the SDK packages and copy the files to your project directory.

    The SDK package includes two directories: **include** and **lib**. The SDK contains two folders as illustrated below: 
    
    ```cpp
    x86            --------------- 32-bit version
    | include      --------------- SDK header file included.
    x64            --------------- 64-bit version
    | include      --------------- SDK header file included.
   ```


### Set project property 

To set project property, right-click the project name in the **Solution Explorer** window, click **Properties**, and configure the following :

1. Add the `include` directory to the header file search path.
* **C/C++** -> **General**-> Add the `include` directory to **Additional include Directories**
2. Add the `lib` directory to the library search path.

* **Linker**-> **General**-> Add the library directory `lib/x86` or ` lib/x64` to the **Additional Library Directories**

3. Specify the link library `ZIM.lib`.

* **Linker**-> **Input**-> Add `ZIM.lib` to **Additional Dependencies**

## Implementation steps

### Get the sample code

To download and run the sample code, see [Sample app](./Sample%20app.mdx).

For the sample code related to this feature, check out the source files in the `CZIMConversationView.h` and `CZIMConversationView.cpp` files under the `ZIMDemo` directory in the SDK sample code package. 



### Import the header file 

Import the header file `ZIM.h` to the project, and define the macro `ZIM_MAIN_CONFIG` once in the source file of the project file (`*.cpp` or `*.cc` file) (you only need to define the macro once at the very beginning).

```cpp
//The header file.
#include "ZIM.h"
...
```

```cpp
//The source file.
#include "pch.h"
#define ZIM_MAIN_CONFIG
#include "framework.h"
...
```

### Create a ZIM SDK instance

Creating a ZIM instance is the very first step, an instance corresponds to a user logging in to the system as a client.


So, let's suppose we have two clients now, client A and client B. To send and receive messages to each other, both of them will need to call the [create](@create) method with the AppID and the AppSign you get in the previous **Prerequisites** steps to create a ZIM SDK instance of their own:

```cpp
// Create a ZIM SDK instance. We recommend creating a ZIM SDK instance for a client.
zim::ZIMAppConfig app_config;
app_config.appID = 0;     //替换为您申请到的 AppID
app_config.appSign = "";   //替换为您申请到的 AppSign
zim_ = zim::ZIM::create(app_config);
```

Since most developers only need to instantiate ZIM once throughout the entire process, We recommends using the [getInstance](@getInstance) method to obtain the created instance object.

```cpp
// After successfully calling the create method to create an instance, you can obtain the zim object via the getInstance method.
// Calling the getInstance method before calling the create method or after calling the destroy method to destroy the instance will return nullptr.
ZIM *zim = ZIM::getInstance();
```

### Set an event handler object 

Before a client user's login, you will need to call the [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler) method to implement an event handler object, and customize the event callbacks, such as you can receive callback notifications when SDK errors occur or receive message related callback notifications.

```cpp
class CZIMEventHandler :public zim::ZIMEventHandler
{
public:
    CZIMEventHandler();
    ~CZIMEventHandler();
private:
    // The callback for receiving error codes. This callback will be triggered when SDK returns error codes.   
    virtual void onError(zim::ZIM* /*zim*/, zim::ZIMError /*errorInfo*/, const std::string& /*desc*/) override;
    // The callback for connection status changes. This callback will be triggered when the connection status changes, and you can customize a UI for this event.
    virtual void onConnectionStateChanged(zim::ZIM* /*zim*/, zim::ZIMConnectionState /*state*/, zim::ZIMConnectionEvent /*event*/, const std::string& /*extendedData*/)  override;
    // The callback for Token expires. This callback will be triggered when the Token is about to expire, and you can customize a UI for this event. 
    virtual void onTokenWillExpire(zim::ZIM* /*zim*/, unsigned int /*second*/)  override;
    // The callback for receiving one-to-one messages. You can receive message notifications through this callback after login. 
    virtual void onPeerMessageReceived(ZIM * /*zim*/, const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<ZIMMessage>> & /*messageList*/,const ZIMMessageReceivedInfo & /*info*/, const std::string & /*fromUserID*/) override;
}
```

```cpp
im_event_handler_ = std::make_shared<CZIMEventHandler>();
zim_->setEventHandler(im_event_handler_);

// You can set the event callbacks by Register##callback_name as needed.
```

For a detailed introduction to the interfaces, please refer to [onConnectionStateChanged](@onConnectionStateChanged), [onTokenWillExpire](@onTokenWillExpire), [onPeerMessageReceived](@onPeerMessageReceived).

<Warning title="Warning">

You need to switch to your own thread for further operations When you receive callbacks.

</Warning>

For example, when you receive an in-room message, to process the message, you need to switch it to your own thread (the following sample code is for switching to the UI thread).

```cpp
// The OnReceiveRoomMessage here refers to the onReceiveRoomMessage of the bounded SDK.
void CZIMDemoDlg::OnRoomMessageReceived(zim::ZIM* zim,
    const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage>>& message_list,
    const ZIMMessageReceivedInfo& info, const std::string& from_room_id)
{
  global_main_dialog_->PostUiThread([=]() {
    global_main_dialog_->im_mode_select_dialog_->OnRoomMessageReceived(zim, message_list, info, from_room_id);
  });
}
```

### Log in to the ZIM SDK

For client A and client B to send, receive, and renew the Token after creating the ZIM SDK instance, they will need to log in to the ZIM SDK.

The clients need to log in using their respective user information. Call the [login](@login__2) interface, passing in the userID and [ZIMLoginConfig](@-ZIMLoginConfig) object to log in.

<Warning title="Warning">

- You can custom the **userID** and **userName**, and we recommend you set the  **userID** to a meaningful value and associate them with the account system of your application.
- For SDK 2.3.0 or later: The SDK uses the AppSign authentication by default. You only need to leave the Token blank when logging in. 
- If you use the Token-based authentication mode, please refer to the [Authentication](./Guides/Users/Authentication.mdx) to get the Token first, and pass it when logging in. 
</Warning>


```cpp
// userID must be within 32 bytes, and can only contain letters, numbers, and the following special characters: '~', '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')', '_', '+', '=', '-', '`', ';', '’', ',', '.', '<', '>', '/', '\'.
//  userName must be within 256 bytes, no special characters limited.
zim::ZIMLoginConfig config;
config.userName = "";
// If you are using the Token-based authentication mode, you will need to fill in the Token which you generated by referring to the [Authentication] doc.
// If you are using the AppSign mode for authentication (the default auth mode for v2.3.0 or later), leave the Token parameter blank. 
config.token = "";

zim_->login(userID, config, [=](zim::ZIMError errorInfo){
    // You can get the return code to check whether the login is successful. And handle it accordingly if the login fails. 
});
```


### Send messages 

Client A can send messages to client B after logging in successfully. 

Currently, the ZIM SDK supports the following message types:

<MarkMessageType />

To send one-to-one messages, for example, client A wants to send a message to client B, then client A needs to call the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method with client B's userID, message content, and the [ZIMConversationType](@-ZIMConversationType)
And client A can be notified whether the message is delivered successfully through the callback [ZIMMessageSentCallback](https://www.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=zim_API~cpp_windows~interface~ZIMDefines#zim-message-sent-callback) (correspond to the `send_callback` shows below).

- [onMessageAttached](@onMessageAttached-ZIMMediaMessageSendNotification) callback: The callback on the message not sent yet. Before the message is sent, you can get a temporary [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage) message for you to implement your business logic as needed. For example, you can get the ID of the message before sending it. Or when sending a message with large content, such as a video, you can get the localMessageID of th

```cpp
// The following shows how to send one-to-one text message.
zim::ZIMMessage* message = nullptr;
zim::ZIMTextMessage text_message;
text_message.message = "message";
// Set priority for the message. 1: Low (by default). 2: Medium. 3: High.
zim::ZIMMessageSendConfig config;
config.priority = zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_LOW;
message = &text_message;

auto smessage = std::make_shared<zim::ZIMTextMessage>("test 1");
auto notification = std::make_shared<zim::ZIMMessageSendNotification>();

notification->onMessageAttached = std::move([=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message) { int i = 0; });

// In 1-on-1 chats, the conversationID is the peer user ID. In group chats, the conversationID is the groupID. In the chat room, the conversationID is the roomID.
zim_->sendMessage(std::static_pointer_cast<zim::ZIMMessage>(smessage), "conversationID",
                          zim::ZIMConversationType::ZIM_CONVERSATION_TYPE_PEER, sendConfig,
                          notification,
                          [=](const std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage> &message,
                              const zim::ZIMError &errorInfo) { int i = 0; });
```


### Receive messages

After client B logs in, he will receive client A's message through the callback [onPeerMessageReceived](@onPeerMessageReceived) which is already set in the [setEventHandler](@setEventHandler) method. 

<Warning title="Warning">

When a message is received, you need to determine whether the message is a Text message or a Command message because these two message types are based on the basic message. You need to convert the basic message class to a concrete message type and then retrieve the message content from the `Message` field.
</Warning>

```cpp
void ZIMConversationView::OnReceivePeerMessage(zim::ZIM* zim, const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<zim::ZIMMessage>>& message_list, const std::string& from_user_id)
{
  for (auto message : message_list)
  {
    if (message->type == zim::ZIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_CUSTOM)
    {
      auto custom_message = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<zim::ZIMCustomMessage>(message);

      CFile file;
      file.Open(L"Binary message file", CFile::typeBinary | CFile::shareDenyNone | CFile::modeCreate | CFile::modeReadWrite);

      file.Write(&custom_message->message[0], custom_message->message.size());
    }
  }

  auto conversation = FindConversation(Utf8ToUnicode(from_user_id), kCurrentConversationTypePeer);
  conversation->messages.insert(conversation->messages.end(), message_list.begin(), message_list.end());
  UpdateConversationList();
}
```

### Log out 

For a client to log out, call the [logout](@logout) method. 

```cpp
zim_->logout();
```

### Destroy the ZIM SDK instance

To destroy the ZIM SDK instance, call the [destroy](@destroy) method.

```cpp
zim_->destroy();
```
