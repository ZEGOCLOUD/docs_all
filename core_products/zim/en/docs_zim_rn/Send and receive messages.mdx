# Send and receive messages

--- 

This document describes how to use the ZIM SDK (In-app Chat) to send and receive messages.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure:

- Go to [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com), and do the following:
  - Create a project, get the **AppID** and **AppSign**.
  - Activate the **In-app Chat** service (as shown in the following figure).

</Frame>

- Platform-specific requirements:
    - React Native 0.60.0 or later
    - A real iOS device that is running on iOS 11.0 or later and supports audio and video.
    -  An Android device or Simulator that is running on Android 4.0.3 or later and supports audio and video. We recommend you use a real device (enable the "USB Debugging" option).
    - Your device is connected to the internet.
    - Configure Visual Studio Code, search for the "React Native Tools" extension, and install it.



## Integrate the SDK  


### Optional: Create a new project

Skip to this step if a project already exists.

<Accordion title="Create a new project" defaultOpen="false">


1. Use React Native's built-in command line utility to create a new project called `Zego-zim-example`.

    
This command line utility doesn't need to be installed and can be used directly with the Node.js `npx` command:

    ```
    npx react-native init zego-zim-example
    ```

2. Compile and run the project on iOS:

    ```
    yarn react-native run-ios
    ```


3. Compile and run the project on Android:

    ```
    yarn react-native run-android
    ```
</Accordion>



### Import the SDK 

The following shows how to integrate the SDK using NPM:

1. Execute the `npm i zego-zim-react-native` or  `yarn add zego-zim-react-native`command to install the dependencies.

    <Note title="Note">

    We recommend you use the NPM package that supports the TypeScript language.
    </Note>

2. Import the SDK.

    ```javascript
    import ZIM from 'zego-zim-react-native';
    ```

3. Go to the iOS root directory, run the `pod install` command to install the dependencies.

After completing the above steps, you can use the `zego-zim-react-native` SDK in your project using JavaScript or TypeScript (recommended).

## Implementation steps

### Get the sample code

Get the sample code from [Sample app](./Sample%20app.mdx).


### Import the SDK file 

Refer to the [**Integrate the SDK using NPM**](#integrate-the-sdk-) to import the SDK package file.


### Create a ZIM SDK instance

Creating a ZIM instance is the very first step, an instance corresponds to a user logging into the system as a client.

So, let's suppose we have two clients now, client A and client B. 

To send and receive messages to each other, both of them will need to call the [create](@create) method with the AppID in the previous **Prerequisites** steps to create a ZIM SDK instance of their own:



```javascript
// Since In-app Chat 2.3.0, the SDK uses the AppSign authentication mode by default. To change the authentication mode:
// 1. For SDK 2.3.3 or later, you can change the authentication mode by yourself.  2. For SDK 2.3.0 or later, if you want to change your authentication mode back to using the Token, contact Technical Support.

// Use a static synchronized method to create a ZIM SDK object and pass the AppID and AppSign. 
// The create method creates a ZIM instance only the first time it is called. Any subsequent use will return null. 
ZIM.create({ appID: 0, appSign: '' });
// Please get a single instance via the getInstance method to avoid hot updates that return null multiple times using the create method.
var zim = ZIM.getInstance();
``` 

### Set event callbacks

Before a client user's login, you will need to call the [on](@on) method to customize the event callbacks, such as you can receive callback notifications when SDK errors occur or receive message-related callback notifications.


```javascript
// Set up and listen for the callback for receiving error codes.  
zim.on('error', function (zim, errorInfo) {
    console.log('error', errorInfo.code, errorInfo.message);
});

// Set up and listen for the callback for connection status changes. 
zim.on('connectionStateChanged', function (zim, { state, event, extendedData }) {
    console.log('connectionStateChanged', state, event, extendedData);
});

// Set up and listen for the callback for receiving one-to-one messages. 
zim.on('peerMessageReceived', function (zim, { messageList, info, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log('peerMessageReceived', messageList, info, fromConversationID);
});

// Register a callback to listen for "Token is about to expire"
zim.on('tokenWillExpire', function (zim, { second }) {
    console.log('tokenWillExpire', second);
    // You can call the renewToken interface here to update the token
    // For new token generation, please refer to the above
    zim.renewToken(token)
        .then(function({ token }){
            // Update successful
        })
        .catch(function(err){
            // Update failed
        })
});
```

For a detailed introduction to the interfaces, please refer to [connectionStateChanged](@connectionStateChanged), [peerMessageReceived](@peerMessageReceived), [tokenWillExpire](@tokenWillExpire).

### Log in to the ZIM SDK

For client A and client B to send, receive messages, and renew the token after creating the ZIM SDK instance, they will need to log in to the ZIM SDK.

To log in, Clients A and B both need to do the following:
1. Call the [ZIMLoginConfig ](@-ZIMLoginConfig) method to create a user object.
2. Then, call the [login](@ login__2) method with their own user information and the Token they get in the previous **Prerequisites** steps.

<Warning title="Warning">

- You can custom the **userID** and **userName**, and we recommend you set the  **userID** to a meaningful value and associate them with the account system of your application.
- For SDK 2.3.0 or later: The SDK uses the AppSign authentication mode by default. You only need to pass the [ZIMUserInfo`\](@-ZIMUserInfo) when logging in. 

- If you use the Token-based authentication mode, please refer to the [Authentication\](./Guides/Users/Authentication.mdx) to get the Token first, and pass it when logging in. 
</Warning>


```javascript
// userID must be within 32 characters, and can only contain letters, numbers, and the following special characters: '~', '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')', '_', '+', '=', '-', '`', ';', 'â€™', ',', '.', '<', '>', '/', '\'.
// userName A string of up to 256 bytes, with no restrictions on special characters.
var userInfo = { userID: 'xxxx', userName: 'xxxx' };
var userID = 'xxxx';
var config = {
   userName: 'xxxx',
     token: '',
 }



// When logging in:
// If you use the Token-based authentication, pass the Token you get by referring to the [Guides - Authentication] document.
// If you use the AppSign authentication mode (the default auth mode by SDK 2.3.0), you need to leave the Token field empty. 

zim.login(userID, config)
    .then(function () {
        // Login successful.
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        // Login failed.
    });
```

### Send messages 

Client A can send messages to client B after logging in successfully. 

The message types currently supported by ZIM are as follows:

<MarkMessageType />

To send one-to-one messages, for example, if client A wants to send a message to client B, then client A needs to call the [sendMessage](@sendMessage) method with client B's userID, message content, and message type (conversationType).

- [ZIMMessageSentResult](@-ZIMMessageSentResult): Callback for the results that whether the message is sent successfully. 

- [onMessageAttached](@onMessageAttached-ZIMMessageSendNotification) callback: The callback on the message not sent yet. Before the message is sent, you can get a temporary [ZIMMessage](@-ZIMMessage) message for you to implement your business logic as needed. For example, you can get the ID of the message before sending it. Or when sending a message with large content, such as a video, you can get the localMessageID of the message before the message is uploaded to implement a Loading UI effect.

```javascript
// The following shows to send a one-to-one message, set the ZIMConversationType to Peer. 
var toUserID = 'xxxx1';
var config = { 
    priority: 1 // Set priority for the message. 1: Low (by default). 2: Medium. 3: High.
};
var type = 0; // Session type. Values are: 0: One-on-one chat.  1: Chat room  2: Group chat.
var notification = {
    onMessageAttached: function(message) {
        // todo: Loading
    }
};

// Send one-to-one text messages. 
var messageTextObj = { type: 1, message: 'Text message content' };
zim.sendMessage(messageTextObj, toUserID, type, config, notification)
    .then(function ({ message }) {
        // Message sent successfully.
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
        // Failed to send the message.
    });
```


### Receive messages

After client B logs in, he will receive client A's message through the callback [on](@on) which is already set in the [peerMessageReceived](@peerMessageReceived) method. 

```javascript 
// Set up and listen for the callback for receiving the one-to-one messages.
zim.on('receivePeerMessage', function (zim, { messageList, fromConversationID }) {
    console.log('receivePeerMessage', messageList, fromConversationID);
});
```


### Log out 

For a client to log out, call the [logout](@logout) method. 

```java
zim.logout();
```

### Destroy the ZIM SDK instance

To destroy the ZIM SDK instance, call the [destroy](@destroy) method.

```java
zim.destroy();
```
