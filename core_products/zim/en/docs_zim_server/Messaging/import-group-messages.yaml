      summary: Import group messages
      description: |
        If you are using another instant messaging service and want to integrate with ZIM, you can call this API to import the group's historical messages (in chronological order) to ZIM.

        <Note title="Note">
        The parameters FromUserId and GroupId only support numbers, English characters, and \'!'，'#'，'$'，'%'，'&'，'('，')'，'+'，'-'，':'，';'，'\<'，'='，'.'，'\>'，'?'，'@'，'['，']'，'^'，'_'，' '，'\{'，'\}'，'|'，'~'.

        To provide developers with a better experience, ZEGOCLOUD recommends that developers use the latest version of the SDK.

        If the sender requests to send a text message with MessageType 1, the sender's corresponding client (SDK version needs to be 2.7.0 or above) will also receive the message.

        For sending and receiving custom messages with MessageType 200, the SDK version of the sender's and receiver's corresponding clients needs to be 2.8.0 or above.

        If the receiver's SDK version is in the [2.0.0, 2.8.0) range, they can receive custom messages, but the message type will be displayed as unknown and the message content cannot be obtained. To obtain this message, please upgrade the SDK to version 2.8.0 or above.

        If the receiver's SDK version is 1.x.x, they will not be able to receive custom messages, nor will they receive unknown messages.
        </Note>
        <Note title="QPS Limit"> 20 times/s</Note>

        ## Verify the effect
        After successfully importing messages, you can call the ZIM server-side API [Query the message list of group chats](/zim-server/conversation/query-the-message-list-of-group-chats) to confirm whether the group chat conversation messages have been imported completely.
