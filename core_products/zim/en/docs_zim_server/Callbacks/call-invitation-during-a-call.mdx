# Callback on call invitation during a call

---

## Description

**Call invitation during a call** refers to the behavior of a user in a call inviting another user to join the call. When a user in a call invites another user to join the call in the client, the business backend will receive the callback on call invitation during a call from the ZIM server to obtain the details of the invitation.

**Usage scenario:** When a user in a call invites another user to join the call, the business backend will receive the callback on call invitation during a call from the ZIM server to confirm whether the invitation is successful.

## Sample code

```json
{
    "appid": "1",
    "event": "call_invite",
    "nonce": "350176",
    "signature": "signature",
    "timestamp": 1499676978,
    "call_id": "3501761173612493269",
    "user_ids": ["abc","def"],

## Return codes
If an HTTP status code 2XX (for example, 200) is returned, the callback succeeded. Otherwise, the callback failed.

## Callback retry policy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the HTTP status code received by the ZEGOCLOUD server is not 2xx (such as 200), it will retry with intervals of 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the retry still fails after an interval of 32s, it will no longer retry.
