When you exit the room or disable all audio/video functions , The audio/video engine will enter the stop state.

<Note title="">
- **Trigger**: The developer called the relevant function to change the state of the audio and video engine. For example: 1. Called ZegoExpressEngine's [startPreview], [stopPreview], [startPublishingStream], [stopPublishingStream], [startPlayingStream], [stopPlayingStream], [startAudioDataObserver], [stopAudioDataObserver] and other functions. 2. The related functions of MediaPlayer are called. 3. The [LogoutRoom] function was called. 4. The related functions of RealTimeSequentialDataManager are called.

| --- | --- | --- |
| channel | [ZegoPublishChannel](../../api-reference/enum#zegopublishchannel) | Publishing stream channel.If you only publish one audio and video stream, you can ignore this parameter. |

**Details**

this callback will be called after SDK rendered the first frame of video data captured. This interface is for preview rendering. The first frame callback is only available for external collection and internal preview. If it is not for SDK rendering, there is no such callback.

<Note title="">
- **Related callbacks**: After the [startPublishingStream] function is called successfully, determine if the SDK actually collected audio data by the callback function [onPublisherCapturedAudioFirstFrame], determine if the SDK actually collected video data by the callback function [onPublisherCapturedVideoFirstFrame].

**Details**

When the audio and video stream is not published [startPublishingStream] or previewed [startPreview] for the first time, the publishing stream or preview first time, that is, the engine of the audio and video module inside the SDK is started, the video data of the local device will be collected, and the collection resolution will change at this time.

<Note title="">
- **Trigger**: After the successful publish [startPublishingStream], the callback will be received if there is a change in the video capture resolution in the process of publishing the stream.
- **Use cases**: You can use this callback to remove the cover of the local preview UI and similar operations.You can also dynamically adjust the scale of the preview view based on the resolution of the callback.
- **Caution**: What is notified during external collection is the change in encoding resolution, which will be affected by flow control.

- **Trigger**: After the [startPlayingStream] function is called successfully, when the remote stream sends SEI, the local end will receive this callback.
- **Caution**: 
 1.The customer can directly operate the UI control in this callback function. 
 2. Since the video encoder itself generates an SEI with a payload type of 5, or when a video file is used for publishing, such SEI may also exist in the video file. Therefore, if the developer needs to filter out this type of SEI, it can be before [createEngine] Call [ZegoEngineConfig.advancedConfig("unregister_sei_filter", "XXXXX")]. Among them, unregister_sei_filter is the key, and XXXXX is the uuid filter string to be set. 
 3. When [mutePlayStreamVideo] or [muteAllPlayStreamVideo] is called to set only the audio stream to be pulled, the SEI will not be received.

**Details**

The uplink and downlink network callbacks of the local and remote users, that would be called by default every two seconds for the local and each playing remote user's network quality.
  Versions 2.10.0 to 2.13.1:
  1. Developer must both publish and play streams before you receive your own network quality callback.
  2. When playing a stream, the publish end has a play stream and the publish end is in the room where it is located, then the user's network quality will be received.
  Versions 2.14.0 to 2.21.1:
  1. As long as you publish or play a stream, you will receive your own network quality callback.
  2. When you play a stream, the publish end is in the room where you are, and you will receive the user's network quality.
  Version 2.22.0 and above:
  1. As long as you publish or play a stream, you will receive your own network quality callback.
  2. When you play a stream, the publish end is in the room where you are, and you will receive the user's network quality.
  3. Estimate the network conditions of the remote stream publishing user. If the remote stream publishing user loses one heartbeat, the network quality will be called back as unknown; if the remote stream publishing user's heartbeat loss reaches 3 Second, call back its network quality to die.
 Use case: When the developer wants to analyze the network condition on the link, or wants to know the network condition of local and remote users.
