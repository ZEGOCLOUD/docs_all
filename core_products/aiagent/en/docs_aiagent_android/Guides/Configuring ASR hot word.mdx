# Configure ASR hot word

---

In specific scenarios, there are often specialized terms such as character names, user names, function names, etc. Temporary hotwords can be set to improve the accuracy of speech recognition.
The speech recognition hotword feature supports setting temporary hotwords at the instance level of an intelligent agent, allowing you to set hotwords specific to each conversation every time you initiate a voice call.

## Quick Start

You can set the hotword list through the `HotWord` parameter in the `ASR` section when registering an intelligent agent ([RegisterAgent](/en/aiagent-server/agent-configuration-management/register-agent)) or creating an intelligent agent instance ([CreateAgentInstance](/en/aiagent-server/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance)).

### HotWord Usage Instructions

- The format for hotwords is: "hotword|weight".
- Each individual hotword should not exceed 30 characters (up to 10 Chinese characters), with weight [1-11]. For example: "ZegoTech|5" or "ASR|11".
- Multiple hotwords should be separated by English commas and combined into one string, supporting up to 128 hotwords. For example: "ZegoTech|10, real-time interaction|5, ASR|11".
- Hotwords cannot contain spaces. For example: "ZegoTech real-time interaction|10".

<Note title="Note">When the hotword weight is set to 11, the current hotword will be upgraded to a super hotword. It is recommended to only set important and necessary hotwords to 11. Setting too many hotwords with a weight of 11 will affect the overall character accuracy rate.</Note>

### Usage Example

Below is an example of setting "ZegoTech" as a hotword.
