# Get AI Agent Status
---

During real-time voice calls with AI Agents, it may be necessary to obtain the status or real-time change messages of the intelligent agent instance in order to promptly handle follow-up processes on the business end or ensure the stability of the business. You can obtain these status messages either through the main calling interface or by listening to corresponding server-side callbacks.

The status messages include the following types:

- Intelligent agent instance status: including idle, listening, thinking, speaking, etc. These can be queried via the server's main calling interface.
- Server exception events: including AI Agent service errors, real-time audio/video RTC related errors, large language model (LLM) related errors, text-to-speech (TTS) related errors (such as TTS concurrency limit exceeded, etc.).

## Quick Implementation

### Get Intelligent Agent Instance Status

Call the <a href="/en/aiagent-server/agent-instance-control/query-agent-instance-status">QueryAgentInstanceStatus</a> interface, and pass in the corresponding `AgentInstanceId`. The server will return the current status of the intelligent agent instance.


<Note title="Note">The successful response to your creation of an agent instance (CreateAgentInstance) includes the `AgentInstanceId` field.</Note>

### Listening for Server Exception Events

Please provide the callback address for receiving exception events and contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for configuration.

When there are exception events on the server, the server will notify you of the exception event information through the callback you have configured. The content example is as follows:

```json
{
    "AppId": 1234567,
    "AgentInstanceId": "1912124734317838336",
    "Data": {
        "Code": 1001,
        "Message": "AI Agent General Error"
    },
    "Event": "Exception",
    "Nonce": "7450395512627324902",
    "Signature": "fd9c1ce54e85bd92f48b0a805e82a52b0c0c6445",
    "Timestamp": 1745502313000
}
```
