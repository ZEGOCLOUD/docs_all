## Product Introduction

[ZEGOCLOUD  AI Agent](https://www.zegocloud.com/solutions/conversational-ai) (hereinafter referred to as "Interactive AI" or "AI Agent"), by integrating the SDK and server-side APIs, you can **quickly achieve** **ultra-low latency IM text and image chatting** between users and AI (agents), **voice calls**, **digital human voice calls**, and other interactive features, thereby fulfilling scenarios such as AI companionship, AI customer service, AI digital human live streaming, etc.

ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent supports custom settings for persona, voice tone, appearance, etc., and is compatible with multiple large language models (LLMs), text-to-speech services (TTS). It also supports long-term memory, external knowledge bases, and model fine-tuning, thereby achieving a more perfect intelligent entity.
## Product Advantages

### Multi-modal Interactive Intelligent Agent
- **Personalized Character**: Define the personality and character of AI through Prompts best practices, combined with RAG, LoRA, etc., to better match roles and meet exclusive needs.
- **Rich Sound Profiles & Voice Cloning**: Over a hundred hyper-realistic sound profiles suitable for various scenarios such as emotional companionship, customer service, e-commerce, etc., with voice cloning capabilities.
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: IM text messages, real-time voice calls, video calls, etc.
- **Extended Premium Photo Digital Human**: As low as 200ms, one photo can be used to give AI a real-time interactive image with accurate lip shapes and realistic facial features.

### Real-time Voice Call Capability
- **Response Delay as Low as 1 Second**. Entirely stream-based processing, based on our self-developed MSDN (Real-time Ordered Data Network), global network nodes are accessed nearby, achieving a delay of as low as 1 second worldwide.
- **Natural Voice Interruption in Just 500ms**. Rapid and precise human voice detection, smooth interruptions without abruptness, continuous interruptions without cross-talk.
- **Precise Speaking State Judgment**. Without affecting response delay, it prevents sentences from being incorrectly split into multiple ones, making AI responses more accurate.

### AI Audio Processing Capabilities Specifically Designed for Intelligent Agents.
- **AI Noise Reduction (AI ANS)**. Eliminates environmental noise, music, distant environmental human voices, etc., supporting interactions in various environments such as offices, homes, cars, etc.
- **AI Voice Activity Detection (AI VAD)**. Accurately identifies effective human voices, filtering out soft responses like "um", "oh", as well as coughs and other noises resembling human sounds.
- **AI Echo Cancellation (AI AEC)**. Precisely eliminates AI voices and background music re-captured by microphones, preventing AI speech from interrupting itself, improving the accuracy of voice when interrupting AI. Also combines functions such as volume ducking and playback volume self-adaptation.

### Personalized Integration
- **Easy Integration**: With less than 10 lines of code, you can add the intelligent agent to IM, real-time voice calls, and digital human real-time calls.
- **Flexible Selection of Large Language Models and Text-to-Speech Plugins**: Supported by multiple domestic and international vendors such as DouBao (Volcano Ark), MiniMax, Volcano Engine, Alibaba Cloud, Step Stars, etc., and also supports open-source models.
- **High Availability and Low-Cost Services**: Fully optimized for calling voice recognition (ASR), large language models (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS), effectively utilizing concurrent resources and usage, reducing overall chain costs.
