# Set ASR Hot Words

---

In certain scenarios, such as handling character names, user IDs or function names, you often encounter terms outside a standard vocabulary. To boost ASR accuracy, you can define temporary hot words.

The hot word feature lets you set these terms per AI-agent instance, so that every time you start a voice call, you can supply conversation-specific hot words to improve recognition of those specialized words.

## Quick Start

You can set the hot word list through the `HotWord` parameter in the `ASR` section when [registering an AI agent](./../api-reference/agent-configuration-management/register-agent.mdx) or [creating an AI agent instance](./../api-reference/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance.mdx).

### HotWord Usage Instructions

- The format for hotwords is: "hotword|weight".
- Each individual hotword should not exceed 30 characters, with weight [1-11]. For example: "ZEGOCLOUD|5" or "ASR|11".
- Multiple hotwords should be separated by English commas and combined into one string, supporting up to 128 hotwords. For example: "ZEGOCLOUD|10, real-time interaction|5, ASR|11".
- Hotwords can not contain spaces. Wrong: "ZEGOCLOUD RTC|10".

<Note title="Note">When the hot word weight is set to 11, the current hot word will be upgraded to a super hot word. It is recommended to only set important and necessary hot words to 11. Setting too many hot words with a weight of 11 will affect the overall character accuracy rate.</Note>

### Usage Example

Below is an example of setting "ZEGOCLOUD" as a hotword.

                }
            }
        },
        "ASR": {
            "HotWord": "ZEGOCLOUD|10"
        }
    }
}
```

```json title="Call the CreateAgentInstance interface to set hot words" {11}
