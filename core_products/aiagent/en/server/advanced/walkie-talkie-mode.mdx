# Interaction Mode: Walkie-Talkie Mode

## Scenario Overview

When interacting with the AI agent, there are several common interaction forms that can be configured through the `AdvancedConfig.CommunicationMode` parameter when [creating an agent instance](/aiagent-server/api-reference/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance):

| Interaction Form         | Interaction Performance with AI Agent                                 | Common Scenarios                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full-Duplex Mode (Default) | Users can speak at any time.                                        | AI voice call                                                 |
| Walkie-Talkie Mode      | Microphone is off by default and turned on as needed, clearly defining when the user starts and stops speaking. | Temporary speaking in online meetings, privacy protection in AI hardware, push-to-talk |
| Listen-Only Mode (Coming Soon) | The AI agent only listens and does not actively reply to the user. | AI interviews, situations where AI needs to listen to the user for a long time without answering |


## Implementation Steps

### Prerequisites
- Enable AI Agent service and complete the basic process according to [Quick Start Voice Call](/aiagent-server/quick-start).

### Implement Different Interaction Forms

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Full-Duplex Mode">
After completing the basic process according to [Quick Start Voice Call](/aiagent-server/quick-start), you can directly interact with AI in full-duplex mode. Refer to sections like [Speech Segmentation Control](/aiagent-server/advanced/speech-segmentation-control) and [Voice Activity Detection VAD Sensitivity](/aiagent-server/advanced/voice-interruption-sensitivity-adjustment) for more refined full-duplex interaction control.

<Step title="Set interaction mode to walkie-talkie mode when creating instance">
Configure the `AdvancedConfig.CommunicationMode` parameter to 2 when [creating an agent instance](/aiagent-server/api-reference/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance) to enable walkie-talkie mode.
</Step>
<Step title="Call server API to let AI listen to user speech">
Call the [StartListening](/aiagent-server/api-reference/agent-instance-control/start-listening) API to let the AI agent listen to user speech.
</Step>
<Step title="Call server API to let AI stop listening to user speech">
Call the [StopListening](/aiagent-server/api-reference/agent-instance-control/stop-listening) API to let the AI agent stop listening to user speech.
</Step>
</Steps>

After completing a full cycle of letting AI listen to user speech and then stopping listening, the AI will reply based on what the user said🎉.
