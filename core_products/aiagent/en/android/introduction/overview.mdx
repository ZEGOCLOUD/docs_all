## Product Introduction

[ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent](https://www.zegocloud.com/solutions/conversational-ai) (hereinafter referred to as "Interactive AI" or "AI Agent") enables you to **quickly implement** ultra-low latency **IM text & image chat**, **voice calls**, and **digital human voice calls** between users and AI (agents) by integrating the SDK and server APIs. This meets the needs of scenarios such as AI companionship, AI customer service, and AI digital human live streaming.
ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent supports custom persona, voice, and avatar settings, supports multiple large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) services, as well as long-term memory, external knowledge base, and model fine-tuning, enabling more advanced and perfect AI agents.

### Multimodal Interactive AI Agent
- **Personalized Persona**: Define the AI's personality and role. Use best practices for prompts, combined with RAG, LoRA, and other methods to better match roles and meet specific requirements.
- **Rich Voice Options & Voice Cloning**: Over a hundred highly human-like voices suitable for emotional companionship, customer service, e-commerce, etc., with support for voice cloning.
- **Multimodal Interaction**: IM text & image messages, real-time voice calls, video calls, and more.
- **Premium Photo-based Digital Human**: With just one photo and as low as 200ms latency, give your AI a real-time interactive avatar with accurate lip sync and realistic facial expressions.

### Real-time Voice Call Capabilities
- **Response latency as low as 1s**. Full streaming processing, with global access via ZEGOCLOUD's proprietary MSDN (Media Streaming Delivery Network) nodes, achieving global latency as low as 1s.
- **Natural voice interruption in just 500ms**. Rapid and accurate human voice detection for smooth, non-intrusive interruptions, with no crosstalk during consecutive interruptions.
- **Accurate speaking state detection**. Ensures that replies are not mistakenly split into multiple sentences, providing more precise AI responses without affecting reply latency.

### AI Audio Processing Tailored for Agents
- **AI Noise Suppression (AI ANS)**: Eliminates environmental noise, music, distant human voices, etc., supporting interaction in various environments such as offices, homes, and cars.
- **AI Voice Activity Detection (AI VAD)**: Accurately detects valid human speech, filtering out soft responses like "um", "oh", as well as coughs and human-like noises.
- **AI Echo Cancellation (AI AEC)**: Precisely removes AI voice and background music picked up by the microphone, preventing AI from interrupting itself and improving speech accuracy during interruptions. Also supports volume ducking and adaptive playback volume.

### Personalized Integration
- **Easy Integration**: Add AI agents to IM, real-time voice calls, or digital human calls with less than 10 lines of code.
- **Flexible LLM and TTS Plugin Selection**: Supports a wide range of domestic and international providers such as Volcano Ark (Doubao), MiniMax, Volcano Engine, Alibaba Cloud, Stepfun, and open-source models.
- **Highly Available and Cost-effective Service**: Optimized invocation of ASR, LLM, and TTS, efficiently utilizing concurrency and usage to reduce overall costs.
