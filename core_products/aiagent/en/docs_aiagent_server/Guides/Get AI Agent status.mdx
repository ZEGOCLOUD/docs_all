# Get AI Agent Status

---

During real-time voice calls with AI Agents, you might need to know the AI agentâ€™s current status or receive exceptions right away so you can quickly handle the next steps or keep your system stable.

You can get these updates by API requests or server callbacks.

The status messages include the following types:
- AI agent instance status: including idle, listening, thinking, speaking, etc. These can be queried via API requests to the ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent server.
- Server exception events: including AI Agent service errors, RTC related errors, LLM errors, TTS errors (such as TTS concurrency limit reached, etc.).

## Quick Implementation

### Get Agent Instance Status

Call the <a href="/aiagent-server/agent-instance-control/query-agent-instance-status">QueryAgentInstanceStatus</a> API, and pass in the `AgentInstanceId` you want to know. The server will return the current status of the AI agent instance.

<Note title="Note">
You can obtain the `AgentInstanceId` from the successful response returned by the [CreateAgentInstance](/aiagent-server/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance) call.
</Note>

### Listen for Server Exception Events

Contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to configure the callback address for receiving exception events.

When there are exception events on the server, the server will notify you of the exception event information through the callback you have configured. The content example is as follows:

```json
{
    "AppId": 1234567,
    "AgentInstanceId": "1912124734317838336",
    "Data": {
        "Code": 1001,
        "Message": "AI Agent General Error"
    },
    "Event": "Exception",
    "Nonce": "7450395512627324902",
    "Signature": "fd9c1ce54e85bd92f48b0a805e82a52b0c0c6445",
    "Timestamp": 1745502313000
}
```
