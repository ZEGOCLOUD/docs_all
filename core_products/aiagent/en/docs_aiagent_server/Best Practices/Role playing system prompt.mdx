# Prompt Engineering for Role-playing

---

A system prompt is the information given to a large language model (LLM) that defines the role it should assume. Tailoring system prompts to specific scenarios and roles helps LLMs perform more effectively and deliver the intended behavior.

You can pass the well-crafted system prompt into the following APIs:

- Passed into the `LLM`-`SystemPrompt` parameter via the [Register An Agent](/aiagent-server/agent-configuration-management/register-agent) interface.
- Passed into the `LLM`-`SystemPrompt` parameter via the [Modify An Agent](/aiagent-server/agent-configuration-management/update-agent) interface.
- Passed into the `LLM`-`SystemPrompt` parameter via the [Create An Agent Instance](/aiagent-server/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance) interface.
- Passed into the `LLM`-`SystemPrompt` parameter via the [Modify An Agent Instance](/aiagent-server/agent-instance-management/update-agent-instance) interface.

## Templates
