## What is ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent?

[ZEGOCLOUD  AI Agent](https://www.zegocloud.com/solutions/conversational-ai) (hereinafter referred to as "AI Agent") provides SDK and server APIs to help you **quickly achieve ultra-low latency IM text and image chatting**, **voice calls**, **digital human voice calls**, and other interactive features between users and AI agents, thereby fulfilling scenarios such as AI companionship, AI customer service, AI digital human live streaming, etc.

ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent supports custom settings for persona, timbre, appearance, etc., and is compatible with various large language models (LLMs) and text-to-speech services (TTS). It also supports long-term memory, external knowledge bases, and model fine-tuning, thereby delivering a more perfect AI agent.‘

## Why Choose ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent?

### Multi-modal Interactive Agent
- **Customizable Character**: You can define the personality and character of AI agents through prompts best practices, combined with RAG, LoRA, etc., to better match roles and meet exclusive needs.
- **Rich  Timbres & Voice Cloning**: Over a hundred hyper-realistic timbres suitable for various scenarios such as emotional companionship, customer service, e-commerce, etc., with voice cloning capabilities.
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Instant text messages, real-time voice calls, video calls, etc.
- **Extended Premium Photo Digital Human**: In as quickly as 200 ms, a single photo is all it takes to generate a real‑time interactive AI avatar—complete with precise lip synchronization and lifelike facial rendering. 


### Real-time Voice Call Capability
- **Response Delay Reduced to 1 Second Worldwide**. ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent adopts fully stream‑based processing, leverages our global MSDN (Real‑time Sequential Data Network), and achieves an as quick as 1s end‑to‑end response delay anywhere in the world.
- **Natural Voice Interruption in 500 ms**. ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent rapidly and accurately detects human speech, seamlessly halts its responses within 500 ms upon interruption, and ensures no cross talk even under successive interrupts.
- **Accurate Speaking‑State Detection**. While maintaining low response latency, ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent prevents sentence fragments from being split, resulting in more precise AI replies.

### AI Audio Processing Capabilities for Agents.
- **AI Noise Reduction (AI ANS)**. Eliminates environmental noise, music, distant environmental human voices, etc., supporting interactions in various environments such as offices, homes, cars, etc.
- **AI Voice Activity Detection (AI VAD)**. Accurately identifies effective human voices, filtering out soft responses like "um", "oh", as well as coughs and other noises resembling human sounds.
- **AI Echo Cancellation (AI AEC)**. Precisely eliminates AI voices and background music re-captured by microphones, preventing AI speech from interrupting itself, improving the accuracy of voice when interrupting AI. Also combines functions such as volume ducking and playback volume self-adaptation.

### Customized Integration
- **Easy Integration**: With fewer than 10 lines of code, you can embed the AI agent into instant messaging, real‑time voice calls, or digital‑human conversations in your app 
- **Flexible Selection of LLM and TTS Plugins**: Flexible LLM & TTS Plugin Options: ZEGOCLOUD AI Agent lets you choose from multiple commercial providers, such as ModelArk, MiniMax, Alibaba Cloud, Stepfun, and more, and also supports open‑source models.
- **Highly Available, Cost‑Efficient Services**: By optimizing ASR, LLM, and TTS calls for concurrency and usage, ZEGOCLOUD minimizes end‑to‑end latency and reduces overall operational costs
