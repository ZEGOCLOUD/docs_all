# Missed call notification and dial-back

<Warning title="Android only">
Notification and dial-back features are only supported on Android.
</Warning>

By default, Call Kit supports users to get the notifications of a missed call and call back automatically by click the notification. However, if users do not want to use the the features, Call Kit also provides disabling methods.

<Warning title="Incompatible with older versions">

If you need the dial-back feature for missed calls (when **enableDialBack** is `true`), the invitation feature will no longer be compatible with versions before v4.12.0. This means that invitations sent by users of versions before v4.12.0 will not be received by users of version 4.12.0 or later, and vice versa.

Therefore, when releasing the app, it is important to implement a force upgrade for users to avoid issues with call reception.

However, if this feature is not enabled (when **enableDialBack** is `false`), the above problem will not bother you.
</Warning>

## Parameters and configurations

The following parameters and configurations are used for the notification and the dial-back. 

- ZegoCallInvitationConfig

  - bool `endCallWhenInitiatorLeave`:

    >  Whether the entire call should end when the initiator leaves the call, causing other participants can not join the call.
    >
    >  The default value is `false` meaning that the call can continue even after the initiator leaves.

- ZegoCallInvitationMissedCallConfig

  - bool `enabled`

      > Used to enable the pop-up notification for missed calls.
      >
      > The default value is `true`.

  - bool `enableDialBack`

      > Whether to allow dial-back the missed when click notification
      >
      > Default value is `true`.
      >
      > Please note that if allowed, it will be incompatible with versions before v4.12.0, meaning that mutual invitations can not be made between the old and new versions of zego_uikit_prebuilt_call.

  - String? `resourceID`

      > The resource ID for notification. It is the same as the one configured on the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/)

  - String? Function()? `notificationTitle`

      > The title for the notification.

  - String? Function()? `notificationMessage`

      > The message for the notification.

  - int `timeoutSeconds`

      > The timeout duration in seconds for the dial-back invitation.

### How to disable missed call pop-up notifications

When you initialize the call invitation service, set the `ZegoCallInvitationMissedCallConfig > enabled` to be `false`.

```dart {6}
ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCallInvitationService().init(
  ...
  config: ZegoCallInvitationConfig(
    endCallWhenInitiatorLeave: true,
    missedCall: ZegoCallInvitationMissedCallConfig(
      enabled: false,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### How to disable missed call dial-back

When you initialize the call invitation service, set the `ZegoCallInvitationMissedCallConfig > enableDialBack` to be `false`.

```dart {6}
ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCallInvitationService().init(
  ...
  config: ZegoCallInvitationConfig(
    endCallWhenInitiatorLeave: true,
    missedCall: ZegoCallInvitationMissedCallConfig(
      enableDialBack: false,
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Events

Listen to the following event callbacks related to the missed call notification and dial-back:

- `onIncomingCallTimeout`: The **callee** will receive a notification through this callback when the callee doesn't respond to the call invitation after a timeout duration.
- `onIncomingMissedCallClicked`: This callback will be triggered to **callee** when **callee** click the missed call notification.
- `onIncomingMissedCallDialBackFailed`: This callback will be triggered when the dial-back of missed call is failed.

```dart {5-30}

  ...
  invitationEvents: ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCallInvitationEvents(

    onIncomingCallTimeout: (
      String callID, 
      ZegoCallUser caller
    ) {

      ///  Add your custom logic here.
    },

    onIncomingMissedCallClicked: (
      String callID,
      ZegoCallUser caller,
      ZegoCallInvitationType callType,
      List<ZegoCallUser> callees,
      String customData,

      /// The default action is to dial back the missed call
      Future<void> Function() defaultAction,
    ) async {
      /// Add your custom logic here.

      await defaultAction.call();
    },

    onIncomingMissedCallDialBackFailed: () {
      /// Add your custom logic here.
