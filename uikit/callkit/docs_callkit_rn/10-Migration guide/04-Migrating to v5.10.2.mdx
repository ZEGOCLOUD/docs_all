# Migrating to v5.10.2

In version 5.10.2, we have added two new dependency libraries (`react-native-device-info` and `zego-callkit-react-native`) to our project. The first one is designed to retrieve device information, and the second one supports push notifications for iOS devices. After upgrading to the latest version of Call Kit, you need run the following command to add these dependencies, and upgrade the versions of `zego-zim-react-native`, `zego-zpns-react-native` and `zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="yarn"
yarn add react-native-device-info zego-callkit-react-native@1.0.6 zego-zim-react-native@2.16.0 zego-zpns-react-native@2.6.6 @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2
```
